[{"question":"What is Angular Framework?","answer":"Angular is a TypeScript-based open-source front-end platform that makes it easy to build web, mobile and desktop applications. The major features of this framework include declarative templates, dependency injection, end to end tooling which ease application development."},{"question":"What is the difference between AngularJS and Angular?","answer":"Angular is a completely revived component-based framework in which an application is a tree of individual components.\nHere are some of the major differences in tabular format:-| AngularJS | Angular |\n|---- | ---------\n| It is based on MVC architecture| This is based on Service\/Controller|\n| It uses JavaScript to build the application| Uses TypeScript to build the application|\n| Based on controllers concept| This is a component based UI approach|\n| No support for mobile platforms| Fully supports mobile platforms|\n| Difficult to build SEO friendly application| Ease to build SEO friendly applications|"},{"question":"What is TypeScript?","answer":"TypeScript is a strongly typed superset of JavaScript created by Microsoft that adds optional types, classes, async\/await and many other features, and compiles to plain JavaScript. Angular is written entirely in TypeScript as a primary language.\nYou can install TypeScript globally as\n```cmd\nnpm install -g typescript\n```\nLet's see a simple example of TypeScript usage:-\n```typescript\nfunction greeter(person: string) {\n    return \"Hello, \" + person;\n}\nlet user = \"Sudheer\";document.body.innerHTML = greeter(user);\n```\nThe greeter method allows only string type as argument."},{"question":"Write a pictorial diagram of Angular architecture?","answer":"The main building blocks of an Angular application are shown in the diagram below:-\n![ScreenShot](images\/architecture.png)"},{"question":"What are the key components of Angular?","answer":"Angular has the key components below,\n\nComponent: These are the basic building blocks of an Angular application to control HTML views.\nModules: An Angular module is a set of angular basic building blocks like components, directives, services etc. An application is divided into logical pieces and each piece of code is called as \"module\" which perform a single task.\nTemplates: These represent the views of an Angular application.\nServices: Are used to create components which can be shared across the entire application.\nMetadata: This can be used to add more data to an Angular class."},{"question":"What are directives?","answer":"Directives add behaviour to an existing DOM element or an existing component instance.\n```typescript\nimport { Directive, ElementRef, Input } from '@angular\/core';\n@Directive({ selector: '[myHighlight]' })\nexport class HighlightDirective {\n    constructor(el: ElementRef) {\n       el.nativeElement.style.backgroundColor = 'yellow';\n    }\n}\n```Now this directive extends HTML element behavior with a yellow background as below\nhtml\n<p myHighlight>Highlight me!<\/p>\n7. ### What are components?\nComponents are the most basic UI building block of an Angular app, which form a tree of Angular components. These components are a subset of directives. Unlike directives, components always have a template, and only one component can be instantiated per element in a template.\nLet's see a simple example of Angular component\n```typescript\nimport { Component } from '@angular\/core';@Component ({\n   selector: 'my-app',\n   template: <div>\n      <h1>{{title}}<\/h1>\n      <div>Learn Angular6 with examples<\/div>\n   <\/div>,\n})export class AppComponent {\n   title: string = 'Welcome to Angular world';\n}\n```"},{"question":"What are the differences between Component and Directive?","answer":"In a short note, A component(@component) is a directive-with-a-template.\nSome of the major differences are mentioned in a tabular form| Component | Directive |\n|---- | ---------\n| To register a component we use @Component meta-data annotation  | To register a directive we use @Directive meta-data annotation |\n| Components are typically used to create UI widgets| Directives are used to add behavior to an existing DOM element |\n| Component is used to break down the application into smaller components| Directive is used to design re-usable components|\n| Only one component can be present per DOM element | Many directives can be used per DOM element |\n| @View decorator or templateurl\/template are mandatory | Directive doesn't use View|"},{"question":"What is a template?","answer":"A template is a HTML view where you can display data by binding controls to properties of an Angular component. You can store your component's template in one of two places. You can define it inline using the template property, or you can define the template in a separate HTML file and link to it in the component metadata using the @Component decorator's templateUrl property.\nUsing inline template with template syntax,\n```typescript\nimport { Component } from '@angular\/core';@Component ({\n   selector: 'my-app',\n   template: '\n      \n{{title}}\nLearn Angular\n\n   '\n})export class AppComponent {\n   title: string = 'Hello World';\n}\n**Using separate template file such as app.component.html**typescript\nimport { Component } from '@angular\/core';@Component ({\n   selector: 'my-app',\n   templateUrl: 'app\/app.component.html'\n})export class AppComponent {\n   title: string = 'Hello World';\n}\n```"},{"question":"What is a module?","answer":"Modules are logical boundaries in your application and the application is divided into separate modules to separate the functionality of your application.\nLets take an example of app.module.ts root module declared with @NgModule decorator as below,\n```typescript\nimport { NgModule }      from '@angular\/core';\nimport { BrowserModule } from '@angular\/platform-browser';\nimport { AppComponent }  from '.\/app.component';@NgModule ({\n   imports:      [ BrowserModule ],\n   declarations: [ AppComponent ],\n   bootstrap:    [ AppComponent ],\n   providers: []\n})\nexport class AppModule { }\n```\nThe NgModule decorator has five important (among all) options:\n1. The imports option is used to import other dependent modules. The BrowserModule is required by default for any web based angular application.\n2. The declarations option is used to define components in the respective module.\n3. The bootstrap option tells Angular which Component to bootstrap in the application.\n4. The providers option is used to configure a set of injectable objects that are available in the injector of this module.\n5. The entryComponents option is a set of components dynamically loaded into the view."},{"question":"What are lifecycle hooks available?","answer":"Angular application goes through an entire set of processes or has a lifecycle right from its initiation to the end of the application.\nThe representation of lifecycle in pictorial representation as follows,\nThe description of each lifecycle method is as below,\n1. ngOnChanges: When the value of a data bound property changes, then this method is called.\n2. ngOnInit: This is called whenever the initialization of the directive\/component after Angular first displays the data-bound properties happens.\n3. ngDoCheck: This is for the detection and to act on changes that Angular can't or won't detect on its own.\n4. ngAfterContentInit: This is called in response after Angular projects external content into the component's view.\n5. ngAfterContentChecked: This is called in response after Angular checks the content projected into the component.\n6. ngAfterViewInit: This is called in response after Angular initializes the component's views and child views.\n7. ngAfterViewChecked: This is called in response after Angular checks the component's views and child views.\n8. ngOnDestroy: This is the cleanup phase just before Angular destroys the directive\/component."},{"question":"What is a data binding?","answer":"Data binding is a core concept in Angular and allows to define communication between a component and the DOM, making it very easy to define interactive applications without worrying about pushing and pulling data. There are four forms of data binding(divided as 3 categories) which differ in the way the data is flowing.\n\n\nFrom the Component to the DOM:\nInterpolation: {{ value }}: Adds the value of a property from the component\nhtml\n<li>Name: {{ user.name }}<\/li>\n<li>Address: {{ user.address }}<\/li>\nProperty binding: [property]=\u201dvalue\u201d: The value is passed from the component to the specified property or simple HTML attribute\nhtml\n<input type=\"email\" [value]=\"user.email\">\n    2. From the DOM to the Component:\nEvent binding: (event)=\u201dfunction\u201d: When a specific DOM event happens (eg.: click, change, keyup), call the specified method in the component\nhtml\n<button (click)=\"logout()\"><\/button>\n    3. Two-way binding:\nTwo-way data binding: [(ngModel)]=\u201dvalue\u201d: Two-way data binding allows to have the data flow both ways. For example, in the below code snippet, both the email DOM input and component email property are in sync\nhtml\n<input type=\"email\" [(ngModel)]=\"user.email\">"},{"question":"What is metadata?","answer":"Metadata is used to decorate a class so that it can configure the expected behavior of the class. The metadata is represented by decorators\n\n\nClass decorators, e.g. @Component and @NgModule\n    ```typescript\n    import { NgModule, Component } from '@angular\/core';\n@Component({\n  selector: 'my-component',\n  template: 'Class decorator',\n})\nexport class MyComponent {\n  constructor() {\n    console.log('Hey I am a component!');\n  }\n}\n@NgModule({\n  imports: [],\n  declarations: [],\n})\nexport class MyModule {\n  constructor() {\n    console.log('Hey I am a module!');\n  }\n}\n2. **Property decorators** Used for properties inside classes, e.g. @Input and @Outputtypescript\nimport { Component, Input } from '@angular\/core';\n@Component({\n    selector: 'my-component',\n    template: 'Property decorator'\n})\nexport class MyComponent {\n    @Input()\n    title: string;\n}\n3. **Method decorators** Used for methods inside classes, e.g. @HostListenertypescript\nimport { Component, HostListener } from '@angular\/core';\n@Component({\n    selector: 'my-component',\n    template: 'Method decorator'\n})\nexport class MyComponent {\n    @HostListener('click', ['$event'])\n    onHostClick(event: Event) {\n        \/\/ clicked, event available\n    }\n}\n4. **Parameter decorators** Used for parameters inside class constructors, e.g. @Inject, @Optionaltypescript\nimport { Component, Inject } from '@angular\/core';\nimport { MyService } from '.\/my-service';\n@Component({\n    selector: 'my-component',\n    template: 'Parameter decorator'\n})\nexport class MyComponent {\n    constructor(@Inject(MyService) myService) {\n        console.log(myService); \/\/ MyService\n    }\n}\n14. ### What is angular CLI?\n    Angular CLI(**Command Line Interface**) is a command line interface to scaffold and build angular apps using nodejs style (commonJs) modules.\n    You need to install using below npm command,\n    npm install @angular\/cli@latest\n    ```\n    Below are the list of few commands, which will come handy while creating angular projects\n    1. Creating New Project: ng new \n\n\nGenerating Components, Directives & Services: ng generate\/g \n    The different types of commands would be,\n\nng generate class my-new-class: add a class to your application\nng generate component my-new-component: add a component to your application\nng generate directive my-new-directive: add a directive to your application\nng generate enum my-new-enum: add an enum to your application\nng generate module my-new-module: add a module to your application\nng generate pipe my-new-pipe: add a pipe to your application\nng generate service my-new-service: add a service to your application\n\n\n\nRunning the Project: ng serve"},{"question":"What is the difference between constructor and ngOnInit?","answer":"The **Constructor** is a default method of the class that is executed when the class is instantiated and ensures proper initialisation of fields in the class and its subclasses. Angular, or better Dependency Injector (DI), analyses the constructor parameters and when it creates a new instance by calling new MyClass() it tries to find providers that match the types of the constructor parameters, resolves them and passes them to the constructor.  \n**ngOnInit** is a life cycle hook called by Angular to indicate that Angular is done creating the component.  \nMostly we use ngOnInit for all the initialization\/declaration and avoid stuff to work in the constructor. The constructor should only be used to initialize class members but shouldn't do actual \"work\".\nSo you should use constructor() to setup Dependency Injection and not much else. ngOnInit() is better place to \"start\" - it's where\/when components' bindings are resolved.\n```typescript\nexport class App implements OnInit{\n  constructor(private myService: MyService){\n     \/\/called first time before the ngOnInit()\n  }ngOnInit(){\n     \/\/called after the constructor and called  after the first ngOnChanges()\n     \/\/e.g. http call...\n  }\n}\n```"},{"question":"What is a service?","answer":"A service is used when a common functionality needs to be provided to various modules. Services allow for greater separation of concerns for your application and better modularity by allowing you to extract common functionality out of components.\nLet's create a repoService which can be used across components,```typescript\nimport { Injectable } from '@angular\/core';\nimport { Http } from '@angular\/http';@Injectable({ \/\/ The Injectable decorator is required for dependency injection to work\n  \/\/ providedIn option registers the service with a specific NgModule\n  providedIn: 'root',  \/\/ This declares the service with the root app (AppModule)\n})\nexport class RepoService{\n  constructor(private http: Http){\n  }fetchAll(){\n    return this.http.get('https:\/\/api.github.com\/repositories');\n  }\n}\n```\nThe above service uses Http service as a dependency."},{"question":"What is dependency injection in Angular?","answer":"Dependency injection (DI), is an important application design pattern in which a class asks for dependencies from external sources rather than creating them itself. Angular comes with its own dependency injection framework for resolving dependencies( services or objects that a class needs to perform its function).So you can have your services depend on other services throughout your application."},{"question":"How is Dependency Hierarchy formed?","answer":"Injectors in Angular have rules that can be leveraged to achieve the desired visibility of injectables in your applications. By understanding these rules, you can determine in which NgModule, Component, or Directive you should declare a provider.\nAngular has two injector hierarchies:Module injectorWhen angular starts, it creates a root injector where the services will be registered, these are provided via injectable annotation. All services provided in the ng-model property are called providers (if those modules are not lazy-loaded).Angular recursively goes through all models which are being used in the application and creates instances for provided services in the root injector. If you provide some service in an eagerly-loaded model, the service will be added to the root injector, which makes it available across the whole application.Platform ModuleDuring application bootstrapping angular creates a few more injectors, above the root injector goes the platform injector, this one is created by the platform browser dynamic function inside the main.ts file, and it provides some platform-specific features like DomSanitizer. NullInjector()At the very top, the next parent injector in the hierarchy is the NullInjector().The responsibility of this injector is to throw the error if something tries to find dependencies there, unless you've used @Optional() because ultimately, everything ends at the NullInjector() and it returns an error or, in the case of @Optional(), null.ElementInjectorAngular creates ElementInjector hierarchies implicitly for each DOM element. ElementInjector injector is being created for any tag that matches the angular component, or any tag on which directive is applied, and you can configure it in component and directive annotations inside the provider's property, thus, it creates its own hierarchy likewise the upper one."},{"question":"What is the purpose of async pipe?","answer":"The AsyncPipe subscribes to an observable or promise and returns the latest value it has emitted. When a new value is emitted, the pipe marks the component to be checked for changes.\nLet's take a time observable which continuously updates the view for every 2 seconds with the current time.\ntypescript\n@Component({\n  selector: 'async-observable-pipe',\n  template: `<div><code>observable|async<\/code>:\n       Time: {{ time | async }}<\/div>`\n})\nexport class AsyncObservablePipeComponent {\n  time: Observable<string>;\n  constructor() {\n    this.time = new Observable((observer) => {\n      setInterval(() => {\n        observer.next(new Date().toString());\n      }, 2000);\n    });\n  }\n}"},{"question":"What is the option to choose between inline and external template file?","answer":"You can store your component's template in one of two places. You can define it inline using the **template** property, or you can define the template in a separate HTML file and link to it in the component metadata using the **@Component** decorator's **templateUrl** property.\nThe choice between inline and separate HTML is a matter of taste, circumstances, and organization policy. But normally we use inline template for small portion of code and external template file for bigger views. By default, the Angular CLI generates components with a template file. But you can override that with the below command,\nng generate component hero -it"},{"question":"What is the purpose of *ngFor directive?","answer":"We use Angular `*ngFor` directive in the template to display each item in the list. For example, here we can iterate over a list of users:\n```html\n<li *ngFor=\"let user of users\">\n  {{ user }}\n<\/li>\n```\nThe user variable in the `*ngFor` double-quoted instruction is a **template input variable**."},{"question":"What is the purpose of *ngIf directive?","answer":"Sometimes an app needs to display a view or a portion of a view only under specific circumstances. The Angular `*ngIf` directive inserts or removes an element based on a truthy\/falsy condition. Let's take an example to display a message if the user age is more than 18:\n```html\n<p *ngIf=\"user.age > 18\">You are not eligible for student pass!<\/p>\n```\n**Note:** Angular isn't showing and hiding the message. It is adding and removing the paragraph element from the DOM. That improves performance, especially in the larger projects with many data bindings."},{"question":"What happens if you use script tag inside template?","answer":"Angular recognizes the value as unsafe and automatically sanitizes it, which removes the script tag but keeps safe content such as the text content of the script tag. This way it eliminates the risk of script injection attacks. If you still use it then it will be ignored and a warning appears in the browser console.Let's take an example of innerHtml property binding which causes XSS vulnerability,\ntypescript\nexport class InnerHtmlBindingComponent {\n  \/\/ For example, a user\/attacker-controlled value from a URL.\n  htmlSnippet = 'Template <script>alert(\"0wned\")<\/script> <b>Syntax<\/b>';\n}"},{"question":"What is interpolation?","answer":"Interpolation is a special syntax that Angular converts into property binding. It\u2019s a convenient alternative to property binding. It is represented by double curly braces({{}}). The text between the braces is often the name of a component property. Angular replaces that name with the string value of the corresponding component property.Let's take an example,\nhtml\n<h3>\n  {{title}}\n  <img src=\"{{url}}\" style=\"height:30px\">\n<\/h3>\nIn the example above, Angular evaluates the title and url properties and fills in the blanks, first displaying a bold application title and then a URL."},{"question":"What are template expressions?","answer":"A template expression produces a value similar to any Javascript expression. Angular executes the expression and assigns it to a property of a binding target; the target might be an HTML element, a component, or a directive. In the property binding, a template expression appears in quotes to the right of the = symbol as in `[property]=\"expression\"`.\nIn interpolation syntax, the template expression is surrounded by double curly braces. For example, in the below interpolation, the template expression is `{{username}}`,\nhtml\n<h3>{{username}}, welcome to Angular<\/h3>The below javascript expressions are prohibited in template expression\n1. assignments (=, +=, -=, ...)\n2. new\n3. chaining expressions with ; or ,\n4. increment and decrement operators (++ and --)"},{"question":"What are template statements?","answer":"A template statement responds to an event raised by a binding target such as an element, component, or directive. The template statements appear in quotes to the right of the = symbol like `(event)=\"statement\"`.\nLet's take an example of button click event's statementhtml\n<button (click)=\"editProfile()\">Edit Profile<\/button>\nIn the above expression, editProfile is a template statement. The below JavaScript syntax expressions are not allowed.\n1. new\n2. increment and decrement operators, ++ and --\n3. operator assignment, such as += and -=\n4. the bitwise operators | and &\n5. the template expression operators"},{"question":"How do you categorize data binding types?","answer":"Binding types can be grouped into three categories distinguished by the direction of data flow. They are listed as below,\n 1. From the source-to-view\n 2. From view-to-source\n 3. View-to-source-to-viewThe possible binding syntax can be tabularized as below,| Data direction | Syntax | Type |\n  |---- | --------- | ---- |\n  | From the source-to-view(One-way)  | 1. {{expression}} 2. [target]=\"expression\" 3. bind-target=\"expression\" | Interpolation, Property, Attribute, Class, Style|\n  | From view-to-source(One-way) | 1. (target)=\"statement\" 2. on-target=\"statement\" | Event |\n  | View-to-source-to-view(Two-way)| 1. [(target)]=\"expression\" 2. bindon-target=\"expression\"| Two-way |"},{"question":"What are pipes?","answer":"Pipes are simple functions that use [template expressions](#what-are-template-expressions) to accept data as input and transform it into a desired output. For example, let us take a pipe to transform a component's birthday property into a human-friendly date using **date** pipe.\n```javascript\nimport { Component } from '@angular\/core';@Component({\n  selector: 'app-birthday',\n  template: <p>Birthday is {{ birthday | date }}<\/p>\n})\nexport class BirthdayComponent {\n  birthday = new Date(1987, 6, 18); \/\/ June 18, 1987\n}\n```"},{"question":"What is a parameterized pipe?","answer":"A pipe can accept any number of optional parameters to fine-tune its output. The parameterized pipe can be created by declaring the pipe name with a colon ( : ) and then the parameter value. If the pipe accepts multiple parameters, separate the values with colons. Let's take a birthday example with a particular format(dd\/MM\/yyyy):\n```javascript\nimport { Component } from '@angular\/core';@Component({\n  selector: 'app-birthday',\n  template: `<p>Birthday is {{ birthday | date:'dd\/MM\/yyyy'}}<\/p>` \/\/ 18\/06\/1987\n})\nexport class BirthdayComponent {\n  birthday = new Date(1987, 6, 18);\n}\n```\nNote: The parameter value can be any valid template expression, such as a string literal or a component property."},{"question":"How do you chain pipes?","answer":"You can chain pipes together in potentially useful combinations as per the needs. Let's take a birthday property which uses date pipe(along with parameter) and uppercase pipes as below\n```javascript\nimport { Component } from '@angular\/core';    @Component({\n      selector: 'app-birthday',\n      template: `<p>Birthday is {{  birthday | date:'fullDate' | uppercase}} <\/p>` \/\/ THURSDAY, JUNE 18, 1987\n    })\n    export class BirthdayComponent {\n      birthday = new Date(1987, 6, 18);\n    }\n```"},{"question":"What is a custom pipe?","answer":"Apart from built-in pipes, you can write your own custom pipe with the below key characteristics:\n\nA pipe is a class decorated with pipe metadata @Pipe decorator, which you import from the core Angular library\n   For example,\n    javascript\n        @Pipe({name: 'myCustomPipe'})\nThe pipe class implements the PipeTransform interface's transform method that accepts an input value followed by optional parameters and returns the transformed value.\n   The structure of PipeTransform would be as below,\n    javascript\n    interface PipeTransform {\n      transform(value: any, ...args: any[]): any\n    }\nThe @Pipe decorator allows you to define the pipe name that you'll use within template expressions. It must be a valid JavaScript identifier.\n    javascript\n    template: `{{someInputValue | myCustomPipe: someOtherValue}}`"},{"question":"Give an example of custom pipe?","answer":"You can create custom reusable pipes for the transformation of existing value. For example, let us create a custom pipe for finding file size based on an extension,\n  ```javascript\n    import { Pipe, PipeTransform } from '@angular\/core';\n\n@Pipe({name: 'customFileSizePipe'})\nexport class FileSizePipe implements PipeTransform {\n  transform(size: number, extension: string = 'MB'): string {\n    return (size \/ (1024 * 1024)).toFixed(2) + extension;\n  }\n}\nNow you can use the above pipe in template expression as below,javascript\n     template: <h2>Find the size of a file<\/h2>\n        <p>Size: {{288966 | customFileSizePipe: 'GB'}}<\/p>\n  ```"},{"question":"What is the difference between pure and impure pipe?","answer":"A pure pipe is only called when Angular detects a change in the value or the parameters passed to a pipe. For example, any changes to a primitive input value (String, Number, Boolean, Symbol) or a changed object reference (Date, Array, Function, Object). An impure pipe is called for every change detection cycle no matter whether the value or parameters changes. i.e, An impure pipe is called often, as often as every keystroke or mouse-move."},{"question":"What is a bootstrapping module?","answer":"Every application has at least one Angular module, the root module that you bootstrap to launch the application is called as bootstrapping module. It is commonly known as `AppModule`. The default structure of `AppModule` generated by AngularCLI would be as follows:\n```javascript\n    import { BrowserModule } from '@angular\/platform-browser';\n    import { NgModule } from '@angular\/core';\n    import { FormsModule } from '@angular\/forms';\n    import { HttpClientModule } from '@angular\/common\/http';import { AppComponent } from '.\/app.component';\n\n\/* the AppModule class with the @NgModule decorator *\/\n@NgModule({\n  declarations: [\n    AppComponent\n  ],\n  imports: [\n    BrowserModule,\n    FormsModule,\n    HttpClientModule\n  ],\n  providers: [],\n  bootstrap: [AppComponent]\n})\nexport class AppModule { }\n```"},{"question":"What are observables?","answer":"Observables are declarative which provide support for passing messages between publishers and subscribers in your application. They are mainly used for event handling, asynchronous programming, and handling multiple values. In this case, you define a function for publishing values, but it is not executed until a consumer subscribes to it. The subscribed consumer then receives notifications until the function completes, or until they unsubscribe."},{"question":"What is HttpClient and its benefits?","answer":"Most of the Front-end applications communicate with backend services over `HTTP` protocol using either `XMLHttpRequest` interface or the `fetch()` API. Angular provides a simplified client HTTP API known as `HttpClient` which is based on top of `XMLHttpRequest` interface. This client is avaialble from `@angular\/common\/http` package.\nYou can import in your root module as below:\njavascript\nimport { HttpClientModule } from '@angular\/common\/http';The major advantages of HttpClient can be listed as below,\n1. Contains testability features\n2. Provides typed request and response objects\n3. Intercept request and response\n4. Supports Observalbe APIs\n5. Supports streamlined error handling"},{"question":"Explain on how to use HttpClient with an example?","answer":"Below are the steps need to be followed for the usage of `HttpClient`.\n\nImport HttpClient into root module:\n    javascript\n    import { HttpClientModule } from '@angular\/common\/http';\n    @NgModule({\n      imports: [\n        BrowserModule,\n        \/\/ import HttpClientModule after BrowserModule.\n        HttpClientModule,\n      ],\n      ......\n      })\n     export class AppModule {}\n\nInject the HttpClient into the application:\n    Let's create a userProfileService(userprofile.service.ts) as an example. It also defines get method of HttpClient:\n    ```javascript\n    import { Injectable } from '@angular\/core';\n    import { HttpClient } from '@angular\/common\/http';\nconst userProfileUrl: string = 'assets\/data\/profile.json';\n@Injectable()\nexport class UserProfileService {\n  constructor(private http: HttpClient) { }\ngetUserProfile() {\n    return this.http.get(this.userProfileUrl);\n  }\n}\n3. Create a component for subscribing service:\nLet's create a component called UserProfileComponent(`userprofile.component.ts`), which injects `UserProfileService` and invokes the service method:javascript\nfetchUserProfile() {\n  this.userProfileService.getUserProfile()\n    .subscribe((data: User) => this.user = {\n        id: data['userId'],\n        name: data['firstName'],\n        city:  data['city']\n    });\n}\n```\n    Since the above service method returns an Observable which needs to be subscribed in the component."},{"question":"How can you read full response?","answer":"The response body doesn't or may not return full response data because sometimes servers also return special headers or status code, which are important for the application workflow. In order to get the full response, you should use `observe` option from `HttpClient`:\njavascript\ngetUserResponse(): Observable<HttpResponse<User>> {\n  return this.http.get<User>(\n    this.userUrl, { observe: 'response' });\n}\nNow HttpClient.get() method returns an Observable of typed HttpResponse rather than just the JSON data."},{"question":"How do you perform Error handling?","answer":"If the request fails on the server or fails to reach the server due to network issues, then `HttpClient` will return an error object instead of a successful reponse. In this case, you need to handle in the component by passing `error` object as a second callback to `subscribe()` method.\nLet's see how it can be handled in the component with an example,\njavascript\nfetchUser() {\n  this.userService.getProfile()\n    .subscribe(\n      (data: User) => this.userProfile = { ...data }, \/\/ success path\n      error => this.error = error \/\/ error path\n    );\n}\nIt is always a good idea to give the user some meaningful feedback instead of displaying the raw error object returned from HttpClient."},{"question":"What is RxJS?","answer":"RxJS is a library for composing asynchronous and callback-based code in a functional, reactive style using Observables. Many APIs such as  HttpClient produce and consume RxJS Observables and also uses operators for processing observables.\nFor example, you can import observables and operators for using HttpClient as below,\njavascript\nimport { Observable, throwError } from 'rxjs';\nimport { catchError, retry } from 'rxjs\/operators';"},{"question":"What is subscribing?","answer":"An Observable instance begins publishing values only when someone subscribes to it. So you need to subscribe by calling the `subscribe()` method of the instance, passing an observer object to receive the notifications.\nLet's take an example of creating and subscribing to a simple observable, with an observer that logs the received message to the console.\n```javascript\n\/\/ Creates an observable sequence of 5 integers, starting from 1\nconst source = range(1, 5);\/\/ Create observer object\nconst myObserver = {\n  next: x => console.log('Observer got a next value: ' + x),\n  error: err => console.error('Observer got an error: ' + err),\n  complete: () => console.log('Observer got a complete notification'),\n};\/\/ Execute with the observer object and Prints out each item\nsource.subscribe(myObserver);\n\/\/ => Observer got a next value: 1\n\/\/ => Observer got a next value: 2\n\/\/ => Observer got a next value: 3\n\/\/ => Observer got a next value: 4\n\/\/ => Observer got a next value: 5\n\/\/ => Observer got a complete notification\n```"},{"question":"What is an observable?","answer":"An Observable is a unique Object similar to a Promise that can help manage async code. Observables are not part of the JavaScript language so we need to rely on a popular Observable library called RxJS.\nThe observables are created using new keyword.\nLet see the simple example of observable,\n```javascript\nimport { Observable } from 'rxjs';const observable = new Observable(observer => {\n  setTimeout(() => {\n    observer.next('Hello from a Observable!');\n  }, 2000);\n});\n```"},{"question":"What is an observer?","answer":"Observer is an interface for a consumer of push-based notifications delivered by an Observable. It has below structure,\njavascript\ninterface Observer<T> {\n  closed?: boolean;\n  next: (value: T) => void;\n  error: (err: any) => void;\n  complete: () => void;\n}\nA handler that implements the Observer interface for receiving observable notifications will be passed as a parameter for observable as below,javascript\nmyObservable.subscribe(myObserver);\nNote: If you don't supply a handler for a notification type, the observer ignores notifications of that type."},{"question":"What is the difference between promise and observable?","answer":"Below are the list of differences between promise and observable:\n| Observable | Promise |\n   |---- | --------- |\n   | Declarative: Computation does not start until subscription, so they can run whenever you need the result | Executes immediately on creation|\n   | Provides multiple values over time | Provides only one |\n   | Subscribe method is used for error handling that facilitates centralized and predictable error handling | Push errors to the child promises |\n   | Provides chaining and subscription to handle complex applications | Uses only .then() clause |"},{"question":"What is multicasting?","answer":"Multi-casting is the practice of broadcasting to a list of multiple subscribers in a single execution.\nLet's demonstrate the multi-casting feature:\n```javascript\nvar source = Rx.Observable.from([1, 2, 3]);\nvar subject = new Rx.Subject();\nvar multicasted = source.multicast(subject);\/\/ These are, under the hood, subject.subscribe({...}):\nmulticasted.subscribe({\n  next: (v) => console.log('observerA: ' + v)\n});\nmulticasted.subscribe({\n  next: (v) => console.log('observerB: ' + v)\n});\/\/ This is, under the hood, `s\n```"},{"question":"How do you perform error handling in observables?","answer":"You can handle errors by specifying an **error callback** on the observer instead of relying on `try`\/`catch`, which are ineffective in asynchronous environment.\nFor example, you can define error callback as below,\njavascript\nmyObservable.subscribe({\n  next(num) { console.log('Next num: ' + num)},\n  error(err) { console.log('Received an errror: ' + err)}\n});"},{"question":"What is the shorthand notation for subscribe method?","answer":"The `subscribe()` method can accept callback function definitions in line, for `next`, `error`, and `complete` handlers. It is known as shorthand notation or Subscribe method with positional arguments.\nFor example, you can define subscribe method as below,\njavascript\nmyObservable.subscribe(\n  x => console.log('Observer got a next value: ' + x),\n  err => console.error('Observer got an error: ' + err),\n  () => console.log('Observer got a complete notification')\n);"},{"question":"What are the utility functions provided by RxJS?","answer":"The RxJS library also provides below utility functions for creating and working with observables.\n\nConverting existing code for async operations into observables\nIterating through the values in a stream\nMapping values to different types\nFiltering streams\nComposing multiple streams"},{"question":"What are observable creation functions?","answer":"RxJS provides creation functions for the process of creating observables from promises, events, timers and Ajax requests. Let us explain each of them with an example:\n\nCreate an observable from a promise\n    javascript\n    import { from } from 'rxjs'; \/\/ from function\n    const data = from(fetch('\/api\/endpoint')); \/\/Created from Promise\n    data.subscribe({\n     next(response) { console.log(response); },\n     error(err) { console.error('Error: ' + err); },\n     complete() { console.log('Completed'); }\n    });\nCreate an observable that creates an AJAX request\n    javascript\n    import { ajax } from 'rxjs\/ajax'; \/\/ ajax function\n    const apiData = ajax('\/api\/data'); \/\/ Created from AJAX request\n    \/\/ Subscribe to create the request\n    apiData.subscribe(res => console.log(res.status, res.response));\nCreate an observable from a counter\n    javascript\n    import { interval } from 'rxjs'; \/\/ interval function\n    const secondsCounter = interval(1000); \/\/ Created from Counter value\n    secondsCounter.subscribe(n =>\n      console.log(`Counter value: ${n}`));\nCreate an observable from an event\n    javascript\n    import { fromEvent } from 'rxjs';\n    const el = document.getElementById('custom-element');\n    const mouseMoves = fromEvent(el, 'mousemove');\n    const subscription = mouseMoves.subscribe((e: MouseEvent) => {\n      console.log(`Coordnitaes of mouse pointer: ${e.clientX} * ${e.clientY}`);\n      });"},{"question":"What will happen if you do not supply handler for the observer?","answer":"Usually, an observer object can define any combination of `next`, `error`, and `complete` notification type handlers. If you don't supply a handler for a notification type, the observer just ignores notifications of that type."},{"question":"What are Angular elements?","answer":"Angular elements are Angular components packaged as **custom elements** (a web standard for defining new HTML elements in a framework-agnostic way). Angular Elements host an Angular component, providing a bridge between the data and the logic defined in the component and the standard DOM APIs, thus, providing a way to use Angular components in `non-Angular environments`."},{"question":"What is the browser support of Angular Elements?","answer":"Since Angular elements are packaged as custom elements the browser support of angular elements is same as custom elements support.\nThis feature is is currently supported natively in a number of browsers and pending for other browsers.| Browser | Angular Element Support |\n|---- | --------- |\n| Chrome | Natively supported|\n| Opera | Natively supported |\n| Safari| Natively supported |\n| Firefox | Natively supported from 63 version onwards. You need to enable dom.webcomponents.enabled and dom.webcomponents.customelements.enabled in older browsers |\n| Edge| Currently it is in progress|"},{"question":"What are custom elements?","answer":"Custom elements (or Web Components) are a Web Platform feature which extends HTML by allowing you to define a tag whose content is created and controlled by JavaScript code. The browser maintains a `CustomElementRegistry` of defined custom elements, which maps an instantiable JavaScript class to an HTML tag. Currently this feature is supported by Chrome, Firefox, Opera, and Safari, and available in other browsers through polyfills."},{"question":"Do I need to bootstrap custom elements?","answer":"No, custom elements bootstrap (or start) automatically when they are added to the DOM, and are automatically destroyed when removed from the DOM. Once a custom element is added to the DOM for any page, it looks and behaves like any other HTML element, and does not require any special knowledge of Angular."},{"question":"Explain how custom elements works internally?","answer":"Below are the steps in an order about custom elements functionality,\n\nApp registers custom element with browser: Use the createCustomElement() function to convert a component into a class that can be registered with the browser as a custom element.\nApp adds custom element to DOM:  Add custom element just like a built-in HTML element directly into the DOM.\nBrowser instantiate component based class: Browser creates an instance of the registered class and adds it to the DOM.\nInstance provides content with data binding and change detection: The content with in template is rendered using the component and DOM data.\nThe flow chart of the custom elements functionality would be as follows,"},{"question":"How to transfer components to custom elements?","answer":"Transforming components to custom elements involves **two** major steps,\n\nBuild custom element class: Angular provides the createCustomElement() function for converting an Angular component (along with its dependencies) to a custom element. The conversion process implements NgElementConstructor interface, and creates a constructor class which is used to produce a self-bootstrapping instance of Angular component.\nRegister element class with browser: It uses customElements.define() JS function, to register the configured constructor and its associated custom-element tag with the browser's CustomElementRegistry. When the browser encounters the tag for the registered element, it uses the constructor to create a custom-element instance.\nThe detailed structure would be as follows,"},{"question":"What are the mapping rules between Angular component and custom element?","answer":"The Component properties and logic maps directly into HTML attributes and the browser's event system. Let us describe them in two steps,\n\nThe createCustomElement() API parses the component input properties with corresponding attributes for the custom element. For example, component @Input('myInputProp') converted as custom element attribute my-input-prop.\nThe Component outputs are dispatched as HTML Custom Events, with the name of the custom event matching the output name. For example, component @Output() valueChanged = new EventEmitter() converted as custom element with dispatch event as \"valueChanged\"."},{"question":"How do you define typings for custom elements?","answer":"You can use the `NgElement` and `WithProperties` types exported from @angular\/elements.\nLet's see how it can be applied by comparing with Angular component.\n1. The simple container with input property would be as below,\n    javascript\n    @Component(...)\n    class MyContainer {\n      @Input() message: string;\n    }\n2. After applying types typescript validates input value and their types,\n    javascirpt\n    const container = document.createElement('my-container') as NgElement & WithProperties<{message: string}>;\n    container.message = 'Welcome to Angular elements!';\n    container.message = true;  \/\/ <-- ERROR: TypeScript knows this should be a string.\n    container.greet = 'News';  \/\/ <-- ERROR: TypeScript knows there is no `greet` property on `container`."},{"question":"What are dynamic components?","answer":"Dynamic components are the components in which the component's location in the application is not defined at build time i.e. they are not used in any angular template. Instead, the component is instantiated and placed in the application at runtime."},{"question":"What are the various kinds of directives?","answer":"There are mainly three kinds of directives:\n\nComponents \u2014 These are directives with a template.\nStructural directives \u2014 These directives change the DOM layout by adding and removing DOM elements.\nAttribute directives \u2014 These directives change the appearance or behavior of an element, component, or another directive."},{"question":"How do you create directives using CLI?","answer":"You can use CLI command `ng generate directive` to create the directive class file. It creates the source file(`src\/app\/components\/directivename.directive.ts`), the respective test file `.spec.ts` and declare the directive class file in root module."},{"question":"Give an example for attribute directives?","answer":"Let's take simple highlighter behavior as a example directive for DOM element. You can create and apply the attribute directive using below step:\n\n\nCreate HighlightDirective class with the file name src\/app\/highlight.directive.ts. In this file, we need to import Directive from core library to apply the metadata and ElementRef in the directive's constructor to inject a reference to the host DOM element ,\n    ```javascript\n    import { Directive, ElementRef } from '@angular\/core';\n@Directive({\n  selector: '[appHighlight]'\n})\nexport class HighlightDirective {\n    constructor(el: ElementRef) {\n       el.nativeElement.style.backgroundColor = 'red';\n    }\n}\n2.

It borrows the concepts or model of browser's application navigation. It enables developers to build Single Page Applications with multiple views and allow navigation between these views."},{"question":"What is the purpose of base href tag?","answer":"The routing application should add <base> element to the index.html as the first child in the <head> tag in order to indicate how to compose navigation URLs. If app folder is the application root then you can set the href value as below\nhtml\n<base href=\"\/\">"},{"question":"What are the router imports?","answer":"The Angular Router which represents a particular component view for a given URL is not part of Angular Core. It is available in library named `@angular\/router` to import required router components. For example, we import them in app module as below,\njavascript\nimport { RouterModule, Routes } from '@angular\/router';"},{"question":"What is router outlet?","answer":"The RouterOutlet is a directive from the router library and it  acts as a placeholder that marks the spot in the template where the router should display the components for that outlet. Router outlet is used like a component,\nhtml\n<router-outlet><\/router-outlet>\n<!-- Routed components go here -->"},{"question":"What are router links?","answer":"The RouterLink is a directive on the anchor tags give the router control over those elements. Since the navigation paths are fixed, you can assign string values to router-link directive as below,\nhtml\n<h1>Angular Router<\/h1>\n<nav>\n  <a routerLink=\"\/todosList\" >List of todos<\/a>\n  <a routerLink=\"\/completed\" >Completed todos<\/a>\n<\/nav>\n<router-outlet><\/router-outlet>"},{"question":"What are active router links?","answer":"RouterLinkActive is a directive that toggles css classes for active RouterLink bindings based on the current RouterState. i.e, The Router will add CSS classes when this link is active and remove when the link is inactive. For example, you can add them to RouterLinks as below.\nhtml\n<h1>Angular Router<\/h1>\n<nav>\n  <a routerLink=\"\/todosList\" routerLinkActive=\"active\">List of todos<\/a>\n  <a routerLink=\"\/completed\" routerLinkActive=\"active\">Completed todos<\/a>\n<\/nav>\n<router-outlet><\/router-outlet>"},{"question":"What is router state?","answer":"RouterState is a tree of activated routes. Every node in this tree knows about the \"consumed\" URL segments, the extracted parameters, and the resolved data. You can access the current RouterState from anywhere in the application using the `Router service` and the `routerState` property.\njavascript\n@Component({templateUrl:'template.html'})\nclass MyComponent {\n  constructor(router: Router) {\n    const state: RouterState = router.routerState;\n    const root: ActivatedRoute = state.root;\n    const child = root.firstChild;\n    const id: Observable<string> = child.params.map(p => p.id);\n    \/\/...\n  }\n}"},{"question":"What are router events?","answer":"During each navigation, the Router emits navigation events through the Router.events property allowing you to track the lifecycle of the route.\nThe sequence of router events is as below,\nNavigationStart,\nRouteConfigLoadStart,\nRouteConfigLoadEnd,\nRoutesRecognized,\nGuardsCheckStart,\nChildActivationStart,\nActivationStart,\nGuardsCheckEnd,\nResolveStart,\nResolveEnd,\nActivationEnd\nChildActivationEnd\nNavigationEnd,\nNavigationCancel,\nNavigationError\nScroll"},{"question":"What is activated route?","answer":"ActivatedRoute contains the information about a route associated with a component loaded in an outlet. It can also be used to traverse the router state tree. The ActivatedRoute will be injected as a router service to access the information. In the below example, you can access route path and parameters,\njavascript\n@Component({...})\nclass MyComponent {\n  constructor(route: ActivatedRoute) {\n    const id: Observable<string> = route.params.pipe(map(p => p.id));\n    const url: Observable<string> = route.url.pipe(map(segments => segments.join('')));\n    \/\/ route.data includes both `data` and `resolve`\n    const user = route.data.pipe(map(d => d.user));\n  }\n}"},{"question":"How do you define routes?","answer":"A router must be configured with a list of route definitions. You configures the router with routes via the `RouterModule.forRoot()` method, and adds the result to the AppModule's `imports` array.\n```javascript\n const appRoutes: Routes = [\n  { path: 'todo\/:id',      component: TodoDetailComponent },\n  {\n    path: 'todos',\n    component: TodosListComponent,\n    data: { title: 'Todos List' }\n  },\n  { path: '',\n    redirectTo: '\/todos',\n    pathMatch: 'full'\n  },\n  { path: '**', component: PageNotFoundComponent }\n];@NgModule({\n  imports: [\n    RouterModule.forRoot(\n      appRoutes,\n      { enableTracing: true } \/\/ <-- debugging purposes only\n    )\n    \/\/ other imports here\n  ],\n  ...\n})\nexport class AppModule { }\n```"},{"question":"What is the purpose of Wildcard route?","answer":"If the URL doesn't match any predefined routes then it causes the router to throw an error and crash the app. In this case, you can use wildcard route. A wildcard route has a path consisting of two asterisks to match every URL.\nFor example, you can define PageNotFoundComponent for wildcard route as below\njavascript\n{ path: '**', component: PageNotFoundComponent }"},{"question":"Do I need a Routing Module always?","answer":"No, the Routing Module is a design choice. You can skip routing Module (for example, AppRoutingModule) when the configuration is simple and merge the routing configuration directly into the companion module (for example, AppModule). But it is recommended when the configuration is complex and includes specialized guard and resolver services."},{"question":"What is Angular Universal?","answer":"Angular Universal is a server-side rendering module for Angular applications in various scenarios. This is a community driven project and available under @angular\/platform-server package.

JIT compilation was the default until Angular 8, now default is AOT. When you run the ng build (build only) or ng serve (build and serve locally) CLI commands, the type of compilation (JIT or AOT) depends on the value of the aot property in your build configuration specified in angular.json. By default, aot is set to true."},{"question":"What is AOT?","answer":"Ahead-of-Time (AOT) is a type of compilation that compiles your app at build time. This is the default starting in Angular 9. When you run the ng build (build only) or ng serve (build and serve locally) CLI commands, the type of compilation (JIT or AOT) depends on the value of the aot property in your build configuration specified in angular.json. By default, aot is set to true.\ncmd\nng build\nng serve"},{"question":"Why do we need compilation process?","answer":"The Angular components and templates cannot be understood by the browser directly. Due to that Angular applications require a compilation process before they can run in a browser. For example, In AOT compilation, both Angular HTML and TypeScript code converted into efficient JavaScript code during the build phase before browser runs it."},{"question":"What are the advantages with AOT?","answer":"Below are the list of AOT benefits,\n\nFaster rendering: The browser downloads a pre-compiled version of the application. So it can render the application immediately without compiling the app.\nFewer asynchronous requests: It inlines external HTML templates and CSS style sheets within the application javascript which eliminates separate ajax requests.\nSmaller Angular framework download size: Doesn't require downloading the Angular compiler. Hence it dramatically reduces the application payload.\nDetect template errors earlier: Detects and reports template binding errors during the build step itself\nBetter security: It compiles HTML templates and components into JavaScript.  So there won't be any injection attacks."},{"question":"What are the ways to control AOT compilation?","answer":"You can control your app compilation in two ways,\n\nBy providing template compiler options in the tsconfig.json file\nBy configuring Angular metadata with decorators"},{"question":"What are the restrictions of metadata?","answer":"In Angular, You must write metadata with the following general constraints,\n\nWrite expression syntax with in the supported range of javascript features\nThe compiler can only reference symbols which are exported\nOnly call the functions supported by the compiler\nDecorated and data-bound class members must be public."},{"question":"What are the three phases of AOT?","answer":"The AOT compiler works in three phases,\n\nCode Analysis: The compiler records a representation of the source\nCode generation: It handles the interpretation as well as places restrictions on what it interprets.\nValidation: In this phase, the Angular template compiler uses the TypeScript compiler to validate the binding expressions in templates."},{"question":"Can I use arrow functions in AOT?","answer":"No, Arrow functions or lambda functions can\u2019t be used to assign values to the decorator properties. For example, the following snippet is invalid:\njavascript\n@Component({\n  providers: [{\n    provide: MyService, useFactory: () => getService()\n  }]\n})To fix this, it has to be changed as following exported function:```javascript\nfunction getService(){\n  return new MyService();\n}@Component({\n  providers: [{\n    provide: MyService, useFactory: getService\n  }]\n})\n```If you still use arrow function, it generates an error node in place of the function. When the compiler later interprets this node, it reports an error to turn the arrow function into an exported function.\nNote: From Angular5 onwards, the compiler automatically performs this rewriting while emitting the .js file."},{"question":"What is the purpose of metadata json files?","answer":"The metadata.json file can be treated as a diagram of the overall structure of a decorator's metadata, represented as an abstract syntax tree(AST). During the analysis phase, the AOT collector scan the metadata recorded in the Angular decorators and outputs metadata information in .metadata.json files, one per .d.ts file."},{"question":"Can I use any javascript feature for expression syntax in AOT?","answer":"No, the AOT collector understands a subset  of (or limited) JavaScript features. If an expression uses unsupported syntax, the collector writes an error node to the .metadata.json file. Later point of time, the compiler reports an error if it needs that piece of metadata to generate the application code."},{"question":"What is folding?","answer":"The compiler can only resolve references to exported symbols in the metadata. Where as some of the non-exported members are folded while generating the code. i.e Folding is a process in which the collector evaluate an expression during collection and record the result in the .metadata.json instead of the original expression.\nFor example, the compiler couldn't refer selector reference because it is not exported\njavascript\nlet selector = 'app-root';\n@Component({\n  selector: selector\n})\nWill be folded into inline selectorjavascript\n@Component({\n      selector: 'app-root'\n    })\nRemember that the compiler can\u2019t fold everything. For example, spread operator on arrays, objects created using new keywords and function calls."},{"question":"What are macros?","answer":"The AOT compiler supports macros in the form of functions or static methods that return an expression in a `single return expression`.\nFor example, let us take a below macro function,\njavascript\nexport function wrapInArray<T>(value: T): T[] {\n  return [value];\n}You can use it inside metadata as an expression,javascript\n@NgModule({\n  declarations: wrapInArray(TypicalComponent)\n})\nexport class TypicalModule {}The compiler treats the macro expression as it written directlyjavascript\n@NgModule({\n  declarations: [TypicalComponent]\n})\nexport class TypicalModule {}"},{"question":"Give an example of few metadata errors?","answer":"Below are some of the errors encountered in metadata,\n\nExpression form not supported: Some of the language features outside of the compiler's restricted expression syntax used in angular metadata can produce this error.\n    Let's see some of these examples,\n    ```javascript\nexport class User { ... }\n   const prop = typeof User; \/\/ typeof is not valid in metadata\n{ provide: 'token', useValue: { [prop]: 'value' } }; \/\/ bracket notation is not valid in metadata\n```\n\n\n\nReference to a local (non-exported) symbol: The compiler encountered a referenced to a locally defined symbol that either wasn't exported or wasn't initialized.\n    Let's take example of this error,\n    ```javascript\n    \/\/ ERROR\n    let username: string; \/\/ neither exported nor initialized\n@Component({\n  selector: 'my-component',\n  template: ... ,\n  providers: [\n    { provide: User, useValue: username }\n  ]\n})\nexport class MyComponent {}\nYou can fix this by either exporting or initializing the value,javascript\nexport let username: string; \/\/ exported\n(or)\nlet username = 'John'; \/\/ initialized\n3. **Function calls are not supported:** The compiler does not currently support function expressions or lambda functions. For example, you cannot set a provider's useFactory to an anonymous function or arrow function as below.javascript\n providers: [\n    { provide: MyStrategy, useFactory: function() { ... } },\n    { provide: OtherStrategy, useFactory: () => { ... } }\n  ]\nYou can fix this with exported functionjavascript\nexport function myStrategy() { ... }\nexport function otherStrategy() { ... }\n... \/\/ metadata\nproviders: [\n    { provide: MyStrategy, useFactory: myStrategy },\n    { provide: OtherStrategy, useFactory: otherStrategy },\n4. **Destructured variable or constant not supported:** The compiler does not support references to variables assigned by destructuring.\nFor example, you cannot write something like this:javascript\nimport { user } from '.\/user';\n\/\/ destructured assignment to name and age\nconst {name, age} = user;\n... \/\/metadata\nproviders: [\n    {provide: Name, useValue: name},\n    {provide: Age, useValue: age},\n  ]\nYou can fix this by non-destructured valuesjavscript\nimport { user } from '.\/user';\n... \/\/metadata\nproviders: [\n    {provide: Name, useValue: user.name},\n    {provide: Age, useValue: user.age},\n  ]\n```"},{"question":"What is metadata rewriting?","answer":"Metadata rewriting is the process in which the compiler converts the expression initializing the fields such as useClass, useValue, useFactory, and data into an exported variable, which replaces the expression. Remember that the compiler does this rewriting during the emit of the .js file but not in definition files( .d.ts file)."},{"question":"How do you provide configuration inheritance?","answer":"Angular Compiler supports configuration inheritance through extends in the tsconfig.json on angularCompilerOptions. i.e, The configuration from the base file(for example, tsconfig.base.json) are loaded first, then overridden by those in the inheriting config file.\njavascript\n{\n  \"extends\": \"..\/tsconfig.base.json\",\n  \"compilerOptions\": {\n    \"experimentalDecorators\": true,\n    ...\n  },\n  \"angularCompilerOptions\": {\n    \"fullTemplateTypeCheck\": true,\n    \"preserveWhitespaces\": true,\n    ...\n  }\n}"},{"question":"How do you specify angular template compiler options?","answer":"The angular template compiler options are specified as members of the **angularCompilerOptions** object in the tsconfig.json file.

It produces error messages when a type error is detected in a template binding expression.\nFor example, consider the following component:\njavascript\n@Component({\n  selector: 'my-component',\n  template: '{{user.contacts.email}}'\n})\nclass MyComponent {\n  user?: User;\n}\nThis will produce the following error:\njavascript\nmy.component.ts.MyComponent.html(1,1): : Property 'contacts' does not exist on type 'User'. Did you mean 'contact'?"},{"question":"What is the purpose of any type cast function?","answer":"You can disable binding expression type checking using $any() type cast function(by surrounding the expression). In the following example, the error Property contacts does not exist is suppressed by casting user to the any type.\n```javascript\n  template:\n  '{{ $any(user).contacts.email }}'\n```\nThe $any() cast function also works with this to allow access to undeclared members of the component.\n```javascript\n   template:\n   '{{ $any(this).contacts.email }}'\n```"},{"question":"What is Non null type assertion operator?","answer":"You can use the non-null type assertion operator to suppress the Object is possibly 'undefined' error.

Since it is not well maintained and failed in majority of the applications, the support is deprecated in latest releases."},{"question":"What is the reason to deprecate web worker packages?","answer":"Both `@angular\/platform-webworker` and `@angular\/platform-webworker-dynamic` are officially deprecated, the Angular team realized it's not good practice to run the Angular application on Web worker"},{"question":"How do you find angular CLI version?","answer":"Angular CLI provides it's installed version using below different ways using ng command,\nbash\n ng v\n ng version\n ng -v\n ng --version\n and the output would be as below,bash\n Angular CLI: 1.6.3\n Node: 8.11.3\n OS: darwin x64\n Angular:\n ..."},{"question":"What is the browser support for Angular?","answer":"Angular supports most recent browsers which includes both desktop and mobile browsers.\n| Browser | Version |\n |---- | --------- |\n | Chrome | latest |\n | Firefox | latest |\n | Edge | 2 most recent major versions |\n | IE | 11, 10, 9 (Compatibility mode is not supported) |\n | Safari | 2 most recent major versions |\n | IE Mobile | 11 |\n | iOS | 2 most recent major versions |\n | Android | 7.0, 6.0, 5.0, 5.1, 4.4 |"},{"question":"What is schematic?","answer":"It's a scaffolding library that defines how to generate or transform a programming project by creating, modifying, refactoring, or moving files and code. It defines rules that operate on a virtual file system called a tree."},{"question":"What is rule in Schematics?","answer":"In schematics world, it's a function that operates on a file tree to create, delete, or modify files in a specific manner."},{"question":"What is Schematics CLI?","answer":"Schematics come with their own command-line tool known as Schematics CLI. It is used to install the schematics executable, which you can use to create a new schematics collection with an initial named schematic. The collection folder is a workspace for schematics. You can also use the schematics command to add a new schematic to an existing collection, or extend an existing schematic. You can install Schematic CLI globally as below,\n ```bash\n npm install -g @angular-devkit\/schematics-cli\n ```"},{"question":"What are the best practices for security in angular?","answer":"Below are the best practices of security in angular,\n\nUse the latest Angular library releases\nDon't modify your copy of Angular\nAvoid Angular APIs marked in the documentation as \u201cSecurity Risk.\u201d"},{"question":"What is Angular security model for preventing XSS attacks?","answer":"Angular treats all values as untrusted by default. i.e, Angular sanitizes and escapes untrusted values When a value is inserted into the DOM from a template, via property, attribute, style, class binding, or interpolation."},{"question":"What is the role of template compiler for prevention of XSS attacks?","answer":"The offline template compiler prevents vulnerabilities caused by template injection, and greatly improves application performance. So it is recommended to use offline template compiler in production deployments without dynamically generating any template."},{"question":"What are the various security contexts in Angular?","answer":"Angular defines the following security contexts for sanitization,\n\nHTML: It is used when interpreting a value as HTML such as binding to innerHtml.\nStyle: It is used when binding CSS into the style property.\nURL: It is used for URL properties such as <a href>.\nResource URL: It is a URL that will be loaded and executed as code such as <script src>."},{"question":"What is Sanitization? Is angular supports it?","answer":"**Sanitization** is the inspection of an untrusted value, turning it into a value that's safe to insert into the DOM. Yes, Angular suppports sanitization. It sanitizes untrusted values for HTML, styles, and URLs but sanitizing resource URLs isn't possible because they contain arbitrary code."},{"question":"What is the purpose of innerHTML?","answer":"The innerHtml is a property of HTML-Elements, which allows you to set it's html-content programmatically. Let's display the below html code snippet in a `<div>` tag as below using innerHTML binding,\nhtml\n <div [innerHTML]=\"htmlSnippet\"><\/div>\n and define the htmlSnippet property from any component\n javascript\n export class myComponent {\n   htmlSnippet: string = '<b>Hello World<\/b>, Angular';\n }\n Unfortunately this property could cause Cross Site Scripting (XSS) security bugs when improperly handled."},{"question":"What is the difference between interpolated content and innerHTML?","answer":"The main difference between interpolated and innerHTML code is the behavior of code interpreted. Interpolated content is always escaped i.e,  HTML isn't interpreted and the browser displays angle brackets in the element's text content. Where as in innerHTML binding, the content is interpreted i.e, the browser will convert < and > characters as HTMLEntities. For example, the usage in template would be as below,\nhtml\n <p>Interpolated value:<\/p>\n <div >{{htmlSnippet}}<\/div>\n <p>Binding of innerHTML:<\/p>\n <div [innerHTML]=\"htmlSnippet\"><\/div>\n and the property defined in a component.javascript\n export class InnerHtmlBindingComponent {\n   htmlSnippet = 'Template <script>alert(\"XSS Attack\")<\/script> <b>Code attached<\/b>';\n }\n Even though innerHTML binding create a chance of XSS attack, Angular recognizes the value as unsafe and automatically sanitizes it."},{"question":"How do you prevent automatic sanitization?","answer":"Sometimes the applications genuinely need to include executable code such as displaying `<iframe>` from an URL. In this case, you need to prevent automatic sanitization in Angular by saying that you inspected a value, checked how it was generated, and made sure it will always be secure. Basically it involves 2 steps,\n\nInject DomSanitizer: You can inject DomSanitizer in component as parameter in constructor\n\nMark the trusted value by calling some of the below methods\n\nbypassSecurityTrustHtml\nbypassSecurityTrustScript\nbypassSecurityTrustStyle\nbypassSecurityTrustUrl\nbypassSecurityTrustResourceUrl\n\n\nFor example,The  usage of dangerous url to trusted url would be as below,javascript\n constructor(private sanitizer: DomSanitizer) {\n   this.dangerousUrl = 'javascript:alert(\"XSS attack\")';\n   this.trustedUrl = sanitizer.bypassSecurityTrustUrl(this.dangerousUrl);"},{"question":"Is safe to use direct DOM API methods in terms of security?","answer":"No,the built-in browser DOM APIs or methods don't automatically protect you from security vulnerabilities. In this case it is recommended to use Angular templates instead of directly interacting with DOM. If it is unavoidable then use the built-in Angular sanitization functions."},{"question":"What is DOM sanitizer?","answer":"`DomSanitizer` is used to help preventing Cross Site Scripting Security bugs (XSS) by sanitizing values to be safe to use in the different DOM contexts."},{"question":"How do you support server side XSS protection in Angular application?","answer":"The server-side XSS protection is supported in an angular application by using a templating language that automatically escapes values to prevent XSS vulnerabilities on the server. But don't use a templating language to generate Angular templates on the server side which creates a high risk of introducing template-injection vulnerabilities."},{"question":"Is angular prevents http level vulnerabilities?","answer":"Angular has built-in support for preventing http level vulnerabilities such as as cross-site request forgery (CSRF or XSRF) and cross-site script inclusion (XSSI). Even though these vulnerabilities need to be mitigated on server-side, Angular provides helpers to make the integration easier on the client side.\n\nHttpClient supports a token mechanism used to prevent XSRF attacks\nHttpClient library recognizes the convention of prefixed JSON responses(which non-executable js code with \")]}',\\n\" characters) and automatically strips the string \")]}',\\n\" from all responses before further parsing"},{"question":"What are Http Interceptors?","answer":"Http Interceptors are part of @angular\/common\/http, which inspect and transform HTTP requests from your application to the server and vice-versa on HTTP responses. These interceptors can perform a variety of implicit tasks, from authentication to logging.\nThe syntax of HttpInterceptor interface looks like as below,javascript\n interface HttpInterceptor {\n   intercept(req: HttpRequest<any>, next: HttpHandler): Observable<HttpEvent<any>>\n }\n You can use interceptors by declaring a service class that implements the intercept() method of the HttpInterceptor interface.javascript\n @Injectable()\n export class MyInterceptor implements HttpInterceptor {\n     constructor() {}\n     intercept(req: HttpRequest<any>, next: HttpHandler): Observable<HttpEvent<any>> {\n         ...\n     }\n }\n After that you can use it in your module,javascript\n @NgModule({\n     ...\n     providers: [\n         {\n             provide: HTTP_INTERCEPTORS,\n             useClass: MyInterceptor,\n             multi: true\n         }\n     ]\n     ...\n })\n export class AppModule {}"},{"question":"What are the applications of HTTP interceptors?","answer":"The HTTP Interceptors can be used for different variety of tasks,\n\nAuthentication\nLogging\nCaching\nFake backend\nURL transformation\nModifying headers"},{"question":"Is multiple interceptors supported in Angular?","answer":"Yes, Angular supports multiple interceptors at a time. You could define multiple interceptors in providers property:\n ```javascript\n providers: [\n   { provide: HTTP_INTERCEPTORS, useClass: MyFirstInterceptor, multi: true },\n   { provide: HTTP_INTERCEPTORS, useClass: MySecondInterceptor, multi: true }\n ],\n ```\n The interceptors will be called in the order in which they were provided. i.e, MyFirstInterceptor will be called first in the above interceptors configuration."},{"question":"How can I use interceptor for an entire application?","answer":"You can use same instance of `HttpInterceptors` for the entire app by importing the `HttpClientModule` only in your AppModule, and add the interceptors to the root application injector.\n For example, let's define a class that is injectable in root application.\n  ```javascript\n  @Injectable()\n  export class MyInterceptor implements HttpInterceptor {\n    intercept(\n      req: HttpRequest<any>,\n      next: HttpHandler\n    ): Observable<HttpEvent<any>> {\n\n  return next.handle(req).do(event => {\n    if (event instanceof HttpResponse) {\n         \/\/ Code goes here\n    }\n  });\n\n}\n}\n  After that import HttpClientModule in AppModulejavascript\n @NgModule({\n   declarations: [AppComponent],\n   imports: [BrowserModule, HttpClientModule],\n   providers: [\n     { provide: HTTP_INTERCEPTORS, useClass: MyInterceptor, multi: true }\n   ],\n   bootstrap: [AppComponent]\n })\n export class AppModule {}\n ```"},{"question":"How does Angular simplifies Internationalization?","answer":"Angular simplifies the below areas of internationalization,\n 1. Displaying dates, number, percentages, and currencies in a local format.\n 2. Preparing text in component templates for translation.\n 3. Handling plural forms of words.\n 4. Handling alternative text."},{"question":"How do you manually register locale data?","answer":"By default, Angular only contains locale data for en-US which is English as spoken in the United States of America . But if you want to set to another locale, you must import locale data for that new locale. After that you can register using `registerLocaleData` method and the syntax of this method looks like below,\n ```javascript\n registerLocaleData(data: any, localeId?: any, extraData?: any): void\n ```\n For example, let us import German locale and register it in the application\n ```javascript\n import { registerLocaleData } from '@angular\/common';\n import localeDe from '@angular\/common\/locales\/de';\nregisterLocaleData(localeDe, 'de');\n ```"},{"question":"What are the four phases of template translation?","answer":"The i18n template translation process has four phases:\n\n\nMark static text messages in your component templates for translation: You can place i18n on every element tag whose fixed text is to be translated. For example, you need i18n attribue for heading as below,\n     javascript\n     <h1 i18n>Hello i18n!<\/h1>\n\n\nCreate a translation file: Use the Angular CLI xi18n command to extract the marked text into an industry-standard translation source file. i.e, Open terminal window at the root of the app project and run the CLI command xi18n.\n     bash\n     ng xi18n\n    The above command creates a file named messages.xlf in your project's root directory.\nNote: You can supply command options to change the format, the name, the location, and the source locale of the extracted file.\n\n\nEdit the generated translation file: Translate the extracted text into the target language. In this step, create a localization folder (such as locale)under root directory(src) and then create target language translation file by copying and renaming the default messages.xlf file. You need to copy source text node and provide the translation under target tag.\n     For example, create the translation file(messages.de.xlf) for German language\n     javascript\n     <trans-unit id=\"greetingHeader\" datatype=\"html\">\n       <source>Hello i18n!<\/source>\n       <target>Hallo i18n !<\/target>\n       <note priority=\"1\" from=\"description\">A welcome header for this sample<\/note>\n       <note priority=\"1\" from=\"meaning\">welcome message<\/note>\n     <\/trans-unit>\n\n\nMerge the completed translation file into the app: You need to use Angular CLI build command to compile the app, choosing a locale-specific configuration, or specifying the following command options.\n\n--i18nFile=path to the translation file\n--i18nFormat=format of the translation file\n--i18nLocale= locale id"},{"question":"What is the purpose of i18n attribute?","answer":"The Angular i18n attribute marks translatable content. It is a custom attribute, recognized by Angular tools and compilers. The compiler removes it after translation.\nNote: Remember that i18n is not an Angular directive."},{"question":"What is the purpose of custom id?","answer":"When you change the translatable text, the Angular extractor tool generates a new id for that translation unit. Because of this behavior, you must then update the translation file with the new id every time.\nFor example, the translation file messages.de.xlf.html has generated trans-unit for some text message as below\n html\n <trans-unit id=\"827wwe104d3d69bf669f823jjde888\" datatype=\"html\">\n You can avoid this manual update of id attribute by specifying a custom id in the i18n attribute by using the prefix @@.\n javascript\n <h1 i18n=\"@@welcomeHeader\">Hello i18n!<\/h1>"},{"question":"What happens if the custom id is not unique?","answer":"You need to define custom ids as unique. If you use the same id for two different text messages then only the first one is extracted. But its translation is used in place of both original text messages.\nFor example, let's define same custom id myCustomId for two messages,\n html\n <h2 i18n=\"@@myCustomId\">Good morning<\/h3>\n <!-- ... -->\n <h2 i18n=\"@@myCustomId\">Good night<\/p>\n and the translation unit generated for first text in for German language as\n html\n <trans-unit id=\"myId\" datatype=\"html\">\n   <source>Good morning<\/source>\n   <target state=\"new\">Guten Morgen<\/target>\n <\/trans-unit>\n Since custom id is the same, both of the elements in the translation contain the same text as below\n html\n <h2>Guten Morgen<\/h2>\n <h2>Guten Morgen<\/h2>"},{"question":"Can I translate text without creating an element?","answer":"Yes, you can achieve using `<ng-container>` attribute. Normally you need to wrap a text content with i18n attribute for the translation. But if you don't want to create a new DOM element just for the sake of translation, you can wrap the text in an <ng-container> element.\n ```html\n <ng-container i18n>I'm not using any DOM element for translation<\/ng-container>\n ```\n Remember that `<ng-container>` is transformed into an html comment"},{"question":"How can I translate attribute?","answer":"You can translate attributes by attaching `i18n-x` attribute  where x is the name of the attribute to translate. For example, you can translate image title attribute as below,\n ```html\n <img [src]=\"example\" i18n-title title=\"Internationlization\" \/>\n ```\n By the way, you can also assign meaning, description and id with the i18n-x=\"<meaning>|<description>@@<id>\" syntax."},{"question":"List down the pluralization categories?","answer":"Pluralization has below categories depending on the language.\n\n=0 (or any other number)\nzero\none\ntwo\nfew\nmany\nother"},{"question":"What is select ICU expression?","answer":"ICU expression is is similar to the plural expressions except that you choose among alternative translations based on a string value instead of a number. Here you define those string values.\nLet's take component binding with residenceStatus property which has \"citizen\", \"permanent resident\" and \"foreigner\" possible values and the message maps those values to the appropriate translations.\n javascript\n <span i18n>The person is {residenceStatus, select, citizen {citizen} permanent resident {permanentResident} foreigner {foreigner}}<\/span>"},{"question":"How do you report missing translations?","answer":"By default, When translation is missing, it generates a warning message such as \"Missing translation for message 'somekey'\". But you can configure with a different level of message in Angular compiler as below,\n\nError: It throws an error. If you are using AOT compilation, the build will fail. But if you are using JIT compilation, the app will fail to load.\nWarning (default): It shows a 'Missing translation' warning in the console or shell.\nIgnore: It doesn't do anything.\nIf you use AOT compiler then you need to perform changes in configurations section of your Angular CLI configuration file, angular.json.\n javascript\n \"configurations\": {\n   ...\n   \"de\": {\n     ...\n     \"i18nMissingTranslation\": \"error\"\n   }\n }\n If you use the JIT compiler, specify the warning level in the compiler config at bootstrap by adding the 'MissingTranslationStrategy' property as below,\n ```javascript\n import { MissingTranslationStrategy } from '@angular\/core';\n import { platformBrowserDynamic } from '@angular\/platform-browser-dynamic';\n import { AppModule } from '.\/app\/app.module';platformBrowserDynamic().bootstrapModule(AppModule, {\n   missingTranslation: MissingTranslationStrategy.Error,\n   providers: [\n     \/\/ ...\n   ]\n });\n ```"},{"question":"How do you provide build configuration for multiple locales?","answer":"You can provide build configuration such as translation file path, name, format and application url in `configuration` settings of Angular.json file. For example, the German version of your application configured the build as follows,\n ```javascript\n \"configurations\": {\n   \"de\": {\n     \"aot\": true,\n     \"outputPath\": \"dist\/my-project-de\/\",\n     \"baseHref\": \"\/fr\/\",\n     \"i18nFile\": \"src\/locale\/messages.de.xlf\",\n     \"i18nFormat\": \"xlf\",\n     \"i18nLocale\": \"de\",\n     \"i18nMissingTranslation\": \"error\",\n   }\n ```"},{"question":"What is an angular library?","answer":"An Angular library is an Angular project that differs from an app in that it cannot run on its own. It must be imported and used in an app. For example,  you can import or add `service worker` library to an Angular application which turns an application into a Progressive Web App (PWA).\nNote: You can create own third party library and publish it as npm package to be used in an Application."},{"question":"What is AOT compiler?","answer":"The AOT compiler is part of a build process that produces a small, fast, ready-to-run application package, typically for production. It converts your Angular HTML and TypeScript code into efficient JavaScript code during the build phase before the browser downloads and runs that code."},{"question":"How do you select an element in component template?","answer":"You can control any DOM element via ElementRef by injecting it into your component's constructor. i.e, The component should have constructor with ElementRef parameter,\n ```javascript\n constructor(myElement: ElementRef) {\n    el.nativeElement.style.backgroundColor = 'yellow';\n }\n ```"},{"question":"What is TestBed?","answer":"TestBed is an api for writing unit tests for Angular applications and it's libraries. Even though We still write our tests in Jasmine and run using Karma, this API provides an easier way to create components, handle injection, test asynchronous behaviour and interact with our application."},{"question":"What is protractor?","answer":"Protractor is an end-to-end test framework for Angular and AngularJS applications. It runs tests against your application running in a real browser, interacting with it as a user would.\n ```javascript\n npm install -g protractor\n ```"},{"question":"What is collection?","answer":"Collection is a set of related schematics collected in an npm package. For example, `@schematics\/angular` collection is used in Angular CLI to apply transforms to a web-app project. You can create your own schematic collection for customizing angular projects."},{"question":"How do you create schematics for libraries?","answer":"You can create your own schematic collections to integrate your library with the Angular CLI. These collections are classified as 3 main schematics,\n\nAdd schematics: These schematics are used to install library in an Angular workspace using ng add command.\n    For example, @angular\/material schematic tells the add command to install and set up Angular Material and theming.\nGenerate schematics: These schematics are used to modify projects, add configurations and scripts, and scaffold artifacts in library using ng generate command.\n    For example, @angular\/material generation schematic supplies generation schematics for the UI components. Let's say the table component is generated using ng generate @angular\/material:table.\nUpdate schematics: These schematics are used to update library's dependencies and adjust for breaking changes in a new library release using ng update command.\n    For example, @angular\/material update schematic updates material and cdk dependencies using ng update @angular\/material command."},{"question":"How do you use jquery in Angular?","answer":"You can use jquery in Angular using 3 simple steps,\n\nInstall the dependency: At first, install the jquery dependency using npm\n     cmd\n        npm install --save jquery\nAdd the jquery script: In Angular-CLI project, add the relative path to jquery in the angular.json file.\n     javascript\n     \"scripts\": [\n        \"node_modules\/jquery\/dist\/jquery.min.js\"\n     ]\n\nStart using jquery: Define the element in template. Whereas declare the jquery variable and apply CSS classes on the element.\n     html\n     <div id=\"elementId\">\n       <h1>JQuery integration<\/h1>\n     <\/div>\n     ```javascript\n     import {Component, OnInit} from '@angular\/core';\ndeclare var $: any; \/\/ (or) import * as $ from 'jquery';\n@Component({\n   selector: 'app-root',\n   templateUrl: '.\/app.component.html',\n   styleUrls: ['.\/app.component.css']\n })\n export class AppComponent implements OnInit {\n   ngOnInit(): void {\n     $(document).ready(() => {\n       $('#elementId').css({'text-color': 'blue', 'font-size': '150%'});\n     });\n   }\n }\n ```"},{"question":"What is the reason for No provider for HTTP exception?","answer":"This exception is due to missing HttpClientModule in your module. You just need to import in module as below,\n ```javascript\n import { HttpClientModule } from '@angular\/common\/http';\n@NgModule({\n   imports: [\n     BrowserModule,\n     HttpClientModule,\n   ],\n   declarations: [ AppComponent ],\n   bootstrap:    [ AppComponent ]\n })\n export class AppModule { }\n ```"},{"question":"What is router state?","answer":"The RouteState is an interface which represents the state of the router as a tree of activated routes.\n ```javascript\n interface RouterState extends Tree {\n   snapshot: RouterStateSnapshot\n   toString(): string\n }\n ```\n You can access the current RouterState from anywhere in the Angular app using the Router service and the routerState property."},{"question":"How can I use SASS in angular project?","answer":"When you are creating your project with angular cli, you can use `ng new`command. It generates all your components with predefined sass files.\n ```javascript\n ng new My_New_Project --style=sass\n ```\n But if you are changing your existing style in your project then use `ng set` command,\n ```javascript\n ng set defaults.styleExt scss\n ```"},{"question":"What is the purpose of hidden property?","answer":"The hidden property is used  to show or hide the associated DOM element, based on an expression. It can be compared close to `ng-show` directive in AngularJS. Let's say you want to show user name based on the availability of user using `hidden` property.\n ```javascript\n <div [hidden]=\"!user.name\">\n   My name is: {{user.name}}\n <\/div>\n ```"},{"question":"What is the difference between ngIf and hidden property?","answer":"The main difference is that *ngIf will remove the element from the DOM, while [hidden] actually plays with the CSS style by setting `display:none`. Generally it is expensive to add and remove stuff from the DOM for frequent actions."},{"question":"What is slice pipe?","answer":"The slice pipe is used to create a new Array or String containing a subset (slice) of the elements. The syntax looks like as below,\n ```javascript\n {{ value_expression | slice : start [ : end ] }}\n ```\n For example, you can provide 'hello' list based on a greeting array,\n ```javascript\n @Component({\n   selector: 'list-pipe',\n   template: `<ul>\n     <li *ngFor=\"let i of greeting | slice:0:5\">{{i}}<\/li>\n   <\/ul>`\n })\n export class PipeListComponent {\n   greeting: string[] = ['h', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o', 'm','o', 'r', 'n', 'i', 'n', 'g'];\n }\n ```"},{"question":"What is index property in ngFor directive?","answer":"The index property of the NgFor directive is used to return the zero-based index of the item in each iteration. You can capture the index in a template input variable and use it in the template.\nFor example, you can capture the index in a variable named indexVar and displays it with the todo's name using ngFor directive as below.\n javascript\n <div *ngFor=\"let todo of todos; let i=index\">{{i + 1}} - {{todo.name}}<\/div>"},{"question":"What is the purpose of ngFor trackBy?","answer":"The main purpose of using *ngFor with trackBy option is performance optimization. Normally if you use NgFor with large data sets, a small change to one item by removing or adding an item, can trigger a cascade of DOM manipulations. In this case, Angular sees only a fresh list of new object references and to replace the old DOM elements with all new DOM elements. You can help Angular to track which items added or removed by providing a `trackBy` function which takes the index and the current item as arguments and needs to return the unique identifier for this item.\nFor example, lets set trackBy to the trackByTodos() method\n javascript\n <div *ngFor=\"let todo of todos; trackBy: trackByTodos\">\n   ({{todo.id}}) {{todo.name}}\n <\/div>\n and define the trackByTodos method,\n javascript\n trackByTodos(index: number, item: Todo): number { return todo.id; }"},{"question":"What is the purpose of ngSwitch directive?","answer":"**NgSwitch** directive is similar to JavaScript switch statement which displays one element from among several possible elements, based on a switch condition. In this case only the selected element placed into the DOM. It has been used along with `NgSwitch`, `NgSwitchCase` and `NgSwitchDefault` directives.\nFor example, let's display the browser details based on selected browser using ngSwitch directive.\n javascript\n <div [ngSwitch]=\"currentBrowser.name\">\n   <chrome-browser    *ngSwitchCase=\"'chrome'\"    [item]=\"currentBrowser\"><\/chrome-browser>\n   <firefox-browser   *ngSwitchCase=\"'firefox'\"     [item]=\"currentBrowser\"><\/firefox-browser>\n   <opera-browser     *ngSwitchCase=\"'opera'\"  [item]=\"currentBrowser\"><\/opera-browser>\n   <safari-browser     *ngSwitchCase=\"'safari'\"   [item]=\"currentBrowser\"><\/safari-browser>\n   <ie-browser  *ngSwitchDefault           [item]=\"currentItem\"><\/ie-browser>\n <\/div>"},{"question":"Is it possible to do aliasing for inputs and outputs?","answer":"Yes, it is possible to do aliasing for inputs and outputs in two ways.\n\nAliasing in metadata: The inputs and outputs in the metadata aliased using a colon-delimited (:) string with the directive property name on the left and the public alias on the right. i.e. It will be in the format of propertyName:alias.\n     javascript\n     inputs: ['input1: buyItem'],\n     outputs: ['outputEvent1: completedEvent']\nAliasing with @Input()\/@Output() decorator: The alias can be specified for the property name by passing the alias name to the @Input()\/@Output() decorator.i.e. It will be in the form of @Input(alias) or @Output(alias).\n     javascript\n     @Input('buyItem') input1: string;\n     @Output('completedEvent') outputEvent1 = new EventEmitter<string>();"},{"question":"What is safe navigation operator?","answer":"The safe navigation operator(?)(or known as Elvis Operator) is used to guard against `null` and `undefined` values in property paths when you are not aware whether a path exists or not. i.e. It returns value of the object path if it exists, else it returns the null value.\nFor example, you can access nested properties of a user profile easily without null reference errors as below,\n javascript\n <p>The user firstName is: {{user?.fullName.firstName}}<\/p>\n Using this safe navigation operator, Angular framework stops evaluating the expression when it hits the first null value and renders the view without any errors."},{"question":"Is any special configuration required for Angular9?","answer":"You don't need any special configuration. In Angular9, the Ivy renderer is the default Angular compiler. Even though Ivy is available Angular8 itself, you had to configure it in tsconfig.json file as below,\n ```javascript\n \"angularCompilerOptions\": {    \"enableIvy\": true  }\n ```"},{"question":"What are type safe TestBed API changes in Angular9?","answer":"Angular 9 provides type safe changes in TestBed API changes by replacing the old get function with the new inject method. Because TestBed.get method is not type-safe. The usage would be as below,\n ```javascript\n TestBed.get(ChangeDetectorRef) \/\/ returns any. It is deprecated now.\nTestBed.inject(ChangeDetectorRef) \/\/ returns ChangeDetectorRef\n ```"},{"question":"Is mandatory to pass static flag for ViewChild?","answer":"In Angular 8, the static flag is required for ViewChild. Whereas in Angular9, you no longer need to pass this property. Once you updated to Angular9 using `ng update`, the migration will remove { static: false } script everywhere.\n ```javascript\n @ViewChild(ChildDirective) child: ChildDirective; \/\/ Angular9 usage\n @ViewChild(ChildDirective, { static: false }) child: ChildDirective; \/\/Angular8 usage\n ```"},{"question":"What are the list of template expression operators?","answer":"The Angular template expression language supports three special template expression operators.\n\nPipe operator\nSafe navigation operator\nNon-null assertion operator"},{"question":"What is the precedence between pipe and ternary operators?","answer":"The pipe operator has a higher precedence than the ternary operator (?:). For example, the expression `first ? second : third | fourth` is parsed as `first ? second : (third | fourth)`."},{"question":"What is an entry component?","answer":"An entry component is any component that Angular loads imperatively(i.e, not referencing it in the template) by type. Due to this behavior, they can\u2019t be found by the Angular compiler during compilation. These components created dynamically with `ComponentFactoryResolver`.\nBasically, there are two main kinds of entry components which are following -\n 1. The bootstrapped root component\n 2. A component you specify in a route"},{"question":"What is a bootstrapped component?","answer":"A bootstrapped component is an entry component that Angular loads into the DOM during the bootstrap process or application launch time. Generally, this bootstrapped or root component is named as `AppComponent` in your root module using `bootstrap` property as below.\n ```js\n @NgModule({\n   declarations: [\n     AppComponent\n   ],\n   imports: [\n     BrowserModule,\n     FormsModule,\n     HttpClientModule,\n     AppRoutingModule\n   ],\n   providers: [],\n   bootstrap: [AppComponent] \/\/ bootstrapped entry component need to be declared here\n })\n ```"},{"question":"How do you manually bootstrap an application?","answer":"You can use `ngDoBootstrap` hook for a manual bootstrapping of the application instead of using bootstrap array in `@NgModule` annotation. This hook is part of `DoBootstap` interface.\n ```js\n interface DoBootstrap {\n   ngDoBootstrap(appRef: ApplicationRef): void\n }\n ```\n The module needs to be implement the above interface to use the hook for bootstrapping.\n ```js\n class AppModule implements DoBootstrap {\n   ngDoBootstrap(appRef: ApplicationRef) {\n     appRef.bootstrap(AppComponent); \/\/ bootstrapped entry component need to be passed\n   }\n }\n ```"},{"question":"Is it necessary for bootstrapped component to be entry component?","answer":"Yes, the bootstrapped component needs to be an entry component. This is because the bootstrapping process is an imperative process."},{"question":"What is a routed entry component?","answer":"The components referenced in router configuration are called as routed entry components. This routed entry component defined in a route definition as below,\n ```js\n const routes: Routes = [\n   {\n     path: '',\n     component: TodoListComponent \/\/ router entry component\n   }\n ];\n ```\n Since router definition requires you to add the component in two places (router and entryComponents), these components are always entry components.\nNote: The compilers are smart enough to recognize a router definition and automatically add the router component into entryComponents."},{"question":"Why is not necessary to use entryComponents array every time?","answer":"Most of the time, you don't need to explicity to set entry components in entryComponents array of ngModule decorator. Because angular adds components from both @NgModule.bootstrap and route definitions to entry components automatically."},{"question":"Do I still need to use entryComponents array in Angular9?","answer":"No. In previous angular releases, the entryComponents array of ngModule decorator is used to tell the compiler which components would be created and inserted dynamically in the view. In Angular9, this is not required anymore with Ivy."},{"question":"Is it all components generated in production build?","answer":"No, only the entry components and template components appears in production builds. If a component isn't an entry component and isn't found in a template, the tree shaker will throw it away. Due to this reason, make sure to add only true entry components to reduce the bundle size."},{"question":"What is Angular compiler?","answer":"The Angular compiler is used to convert the application code into JavaScript code. It reads the template markup, combines it with the corresponding component class code, and emits component factories which creates JavaScript representation of the component along with elements of @Component metadata."},{"question":"What is the role of ngModule metadata in compilation process?","answer":"The `@NgModule` metadata is used to tell the Angular compiler what components to be compiled for this module and how to link this module with other modules."},{"question":"How does angular finds components, directives and pipes?","answer":"The Angular compiler finds a component or directive in a template when it can match the selector of that component or directive in that template. Whereas it finds a pipe if the pipe's name appears within the pipe syntax of the template HTML."},{"question":"Give few examples for NgModules?","answer":"The Angular core libraries and third-party libraries are available as NgModules.\n\nAngular libraries such as FormsModule, HttpClientModule, and RouterModule are NgModules.\nMany third-party libraries such as Material Design, Ionic, and AngularFire2 are NgModules."},{"question":"What are feature modules?","answer":"Feature modules are NgModules, which are used for the purpose of organizing code. The feature module can be created with Angular CLI using the below command in the root directory,\n ```javascript\n ng generate module MyCustomFeature \/\/\n ```\n Angular CLI creates a folder called `my-custom-feature` with a file inside called `my-custom-feature.module.ts` with the following contents\n ```javascript\n import { NgModule } from '@angular\/core';\n import { CommonModule } from '@angular\/common';\n@NgModule({\n   imports: [\n     CommonModule\n   ],\n   declarations: []\n })\n export class MyCustomFeature { }\n ```Note:  The \"Module\" suffix shouldn't present in the name because the CLI appends it."},{"question":"What are the imported modules in CLI generated feature modules?","answer":"In the CLI generated feature module, there are two JavaScript import statements at the top of the file\n\nNgModule: InOrder to use the @NgModule decorator\nCommonModule: It provides many common directives such as ngIf and ngFor."},{"question":"What are the differences between ngmodule and javascript module?","answer":"Below are the main differences between Angular NgModule and javascript module,\n| NgModule | JavaScript module |\n |---- | --------- |\n | NgModule bounds declarable classes only | There is no restriction classes |\n | List the module's classes in declarations array only | Can define all member classes in one giant file |\n | It only export the declarable classes it owns or imports from other modules| It can export any classes |\n | Extend the entire application with services by adding providers to provides array | Can't extend the application with services |"},{"question":"What are the possible errors with declarations?","answer":"There are two common possible errors with declarations array,\n\nIf you use a component without declaring it, Angular returns an error message.\nIf you try to declare the same class in more than one module then compiler emits an error."},{"question":"What are the steps to use declaration elements?","answer":"Below are the steps to be followed to use declaration elements.\n\nCreate the element(component, directive and pipes) and export it from the file where you wrote it\nImport it into the appropriate module.\nDeclare it in the @NgModule declarations array."},{"question":"What happens if browserModule used in feature module?","answer":"If you do import `BrowserModule` into a lazy loaded feature module, Angular returns an error telling you to use `CommonModule` instead. Because BrowserModule\u2019s providers are for the entire app so it should only be in the root module, not in feature module. Whereas Feature modules only need the common directives in CommonModule."},{"question":"What are the types of feature modules?","answer":"Below are the five categories of feature modules,\n\nDomain: Deliver a user experience dedicated to a particular application domain(For example, place an order, registration etc)\nRouted: These are domain feature modules whose top components are the targets of router navigation routes.\nRouting: It provides routing configuration for another module.\nService: It provides utility services such as data access and messaging(For example, HttpClientModule)\nWidget: It makes components, directives, and pipes available to external modules(For example, third-party libraries such as Material UI)"},{"question":"What is a provider?","answer":"A provider is an instruction to the Dependency Injection system on how to obtain a value for a dependency(aka services created). The service can be provided using Angular CLI as below,\n ```javascript\n ng generate service my-service\n ```\n The created service by CLI would be as below,\n ```js\n import { Injectable } from '@angular\/core';\n@Injectable({\n   providedIn: 'root', \/\/Angular provide the service in root injector\n })\n export class MyService {\n }\n ```"},{"question":"What is the recommendation for provider scope?","answer":"You should always provide your service in the root injector unless there is a case where you want the service to be available only if you import a particular @NgModule."},{"question":"How do you restrict provider scope to a module?","answer":"It is possible to restrict service provider scope to a specific module instead making available to entire application. There are two possible ways to do it.\n\n\nUsing providedIn in service:\n     ```js\n     import { Injectable } from '@angular\/core';\n     import { SomeModule } from '.\/some.module';\n@Injectable({\n   providedIn: SomeModule,\n })\n export class SomeService {\n }\n 2. **Declare provider for the service in module:**js\n import { NgModule } from '@angular\/core';\nimport { SomeService } from '.\/some.service';\n@NgModule({\n   providers: [SomeService],\n })\n export class SomeModule {\n }\n ```"},{"question":"How do you provide a singleton service?","answer":"There are two possible ways to provide a singleton service.\n\n\nSet the providedIn property of the @Injectable() to \"root\". This is the preferred way(starting from Angular 6.0) of creating a singleton service since it makes your services tree-shakable.\n```js\n import { Injectable } from '@angular\/core';\n@Injectable({\n   providedIn: 'root',\n })\n export class MyService {\n }\n ```\n     2. Include the service in root module or in a module that is only imported by root module. It has been used to register services before Angular 6.0.\njs\n @NgModule({\n   ...\n   providers: [MyService],\n   ...\n })"},{"question":"What are the different ways to remove duplicate service registration?","answer":"If a module defines provides and declarations then loading the module in multiple feature modules will duplicate the registration of the service. Below are the different ways to prevent this duplicate behavior.\n\nUse the providedIn syntax instead of registering the service in the module.\nSeparate your services into their own module.\nDefine forRoot() and forChild() methods in the module."},{"question":"How does forRoot method helpful to avoid duplicate router instances?","answer":"If the `RouterModule` module didn\u2019t have forRoot() static method then each feature module would instantiate a new Router instance, which leads to broken application due to duplicate instances. After using forRoot() method, the root application module imports `RouterModule.forRoot(...)` and gets a Router, and all feature modules import `RouterModule.forChild(...)` which does not instantiate another Router."},{"question":"What is a shared module?","answer":"The Shared Module is the module in which you put commonly used directives, pipes, and components into one module that is shared(import it) throughout the application.\nFor example, the below shared module imports CommonModule, FormsModule for common directives and components, pipes and directives based on the need,\n ```js\n import { CommonModule } from '@angular\/common';\n import { NgModule } from '@angular\/core';\n import { FormsModule } from '@angular\/forms';\n import { UserComponent } from '.\/user.component';\n import { NewUserDirective } from '.\/new-user.directive';\n import { OrdersPipe } from '.\/orders.pipe';@NgModule({\n  imports:      [ CommonModule ],\n  declarations: [ UserComponent, NewUserDirective, OrdersPipe ],\n  exports:      [ UserComponent, NewUserDirective, OrdersPipe,\n                  CommonModule, FormsModule ]\n })\n export class SharedModule { }\n ```"},{"question":"Can I share services using modules?","answer":"No, it is not recommended to share services by importing module. i.e Import modules when you want to use directives, pipes, and components only. The best approach to get a hold of shared services is through 'Angular dependency injection' because importing a module will result in a new service instance."},{"question":"How do you get current direction for locales?","answer":"In Angular 9.1, the API method `getLocaleDirection` can be used to get the current direction in your app. This method is useful to support Right to Left locales for your Internationalization based applications.\n ```js\n import { getLocaleDirection, registerLocaleData } from '@angular\/common';\n import { LOCALE_ID } from '@angular\/core';\n import localeAr from '@angular\/common\/locales\/ar';\n...constructor(@Inject(LOCALE_ID) locale) { const directionForLocale = getLocaleDirection(locale); \/\/ Returns 'rtl' or 'ltr' based on the current locale\n registerLocaleData(localeAr, 'ar-ae');\n const direction = getLocaleDirection('ar-ae'); \/\/ Returns 'rtl'\n\n \/\/ Current direction is used to provide conditional logic here\n}\n ```"},{"question":"What is ngcc?","answer":"The ngcc(Angular Compatibility Compiler) is a tool which upgrades node_module compiled with non-ivy ngc into ivy compliant format.

Let's say the new file named zone-flags.js,\n ```js\n \/\/ disable patching requestAnimationFrame\n (window as any).__Zone_disable_requestAnimationFrame = true;\n\/\/ disable patching specified eventNames\n (window as any).__zone_symbol__UNPATCHED_EVENTS = ['scroll', 'mousemove'];\n The above configuration file can be imported in a polyfill.ts file as below,js\n \/**************\n  * Zone JS is required by default for Angular.\n  \/\n import .\/zone-flags;\n import 'zone.js\/dist\/zone';  \/\/ Included with Angular CLI.\n ```"},{"question":"How do you trigger an animation?","answer":"Angular provides a `trigger()` function for animation in order to collect the states and transitions with a specific animation name, so that you can attach it to the triggering element in the HTML template. This function watch for changes and trigger initiates the actions when a change occurs.\n For example, let's create trigger named `upDown`, and attach it to the button element.\n ```js\n content_copy\n @Component({\n   selector: 'app-up-down',\n   animations: [\n     trigger('upDown', [\n       state('up', style({\n         height: '200px',\n         opacity: 1,\n         backgroundColor: 'yellow'\n       })),\n       state('down', style({\n         height: '100px',\n         opacity: 0.5,\n         backgroundColor: 'green'\n       })),\n       transition('up => down', [\n         animate('1s')\n       ]),\n       transition('down => up', [\n         animate('0.5s')\n       ]),\n     ]),\n   ],\n   templateUrl: 'up-down.component.html',\n   styleUrls: ['up-down.component.css']\n })\n export class UpDownComponent {\n   isUp = true;\ntoggle() {\n     this.isUp = !this.isUp;\n   }```"},{"question":"How do you configure injectors with providers at different levels?","answer":"You can configure injectors with providers at different levels of your application by setting a metadata value. The configuration can happen in one of three places,\n\nIn the @Injectable() decorator for the service itself\nIn the @NgModule() decorator for an NgModule\nIn the @Component() decorator for a component"},{"question":"Is it mandatory to use injectable on every service class?","answer":"No. The `@Injectable()` decorator is not strictly required if the class has other Angular decorators on it or does not have any dependencies. But the important thing here is any class that is going to be injected with Angular is decorated.\n i.e, If we add the decorator, the metadata `design:paramtypes` is added, and the dependency injection can do it's job. That is the exact reason to add the @Injectable() decorator on a service if this service has some dependencies itself.\n For example, Let's see the different variations of AppService in a root component,\n\nThe below AppService can be injected in AppComponent without any problems. This is because there are no dependency services inside AppService.\n     js\n     export class AppService {\n       constructor() {\n         console.log('A new app service');\n       }\n     }\n\nThe below AppService with dummy decorator and httpService can be injected in AppComponent without any problems. This is because meta information is generated with dummy decorator.\n     ```js\n     function SomeDummyDecorator() {\n       return (constructor: Function) => console.log(constructor);\n     }\n@SomeDummyDecorator()\n export class AppService {\n   constructor(http: HttpService) {\n     console.log(http);\n   }\n }\n and the generated javascript code of above service has meta information about HttpService,js\n var AppService = (function () {\n     function AppService(http) {\n         console.log(http);\n     }\n     AppService = __decorate([\n         core_1.Injectable(),\n         __metadata('design:paramtypes', [http_service_1.HttpService])\n     ], AppService);\n     return AppService;\n }());\n exports.AppService = AppService;\n 3. The below AppService with @injectable decorator and httpService can be injected in AppComponent without any problems. This is because meta information is generated with Injectable decorator.js\n @Injectable({\n   providedIn: 'root',\n })\n export class AppService {\n   constructor(http: HttpService) {\n     console.log(http);\n   }\n }\n ```"},{"question":"What is an optional dependency?","answer":"The optional dependency is a parameter decorator to be used on constructor parameters, which marks the parameter as being an optional dependency. Due to this, the DI framework provides null if the dependency is not found.\n For example, If you don't register a logger provider anywhere, the injector sets the value of logger(or logger service) to null in the below class.\n ```js\n import { Optional } from '@angular\/core';\nconstructor(@Optional() private logger?: Logger) {\n   if (this.logger) {\n     this.logger.log('This is an optional dependency message');\n   } else {\n     console.log('The logger is not registered');\n   }\n }\n ```"},{"question":"What are the types of injector hierarchies?","answer":"There are two types of injector hierarchies in Angular\n\nModuleInjector hierarchy: It configure on a module level using an @NgModule() or @Injectable() annotation.\nElementInjector hierarchy: It created implicitly at each DOM element.

You can create them based on reactive form API."},{"question":"What are template driven forms?","answer":"Template driven forms are model-driven forms where you write the logic, validations, controls etc, in the template part of the code using directives. They are suitable for simple scenarios and uses two-way binding with [(ngModel)] syntax.\n For example, you can create register form easily by following the below simple steps,\n\nImport the FormsModule into the Application module's imports array\n     js\n        import { BrowserModule } from '@angular\/platform-browser';\n        import { NgModule } from '@angular\/core';\n        import {FormsModule} from '@angular\/forms'\n        import { RegisterComponent } from '.\/app.component';\n        @NgModule({\n          declarations: [\n            RegisterComponent,\n          ],\n          imports: [\n            BrowserModule,\n            FormsModule\n          ],\n          providers: [],\n          bootstrap: [RegisterComponent]\n        })\n        export class AppModule { }\nBind the form from template to the component using ngModel syntax\n     html\n     <input type=\"text\" class=\"form-control\" id=\"name\"\n       required\n       [(ngModel)]=\"model.name\" name=\"name\">\nAttach NgForm directive to the  tag in order to create FormControl instances and register them\n     js\n     <form #registerForm=\"ngForm\">\nApply the validation message for form controls\n     html\n     <label for=\"name\">Name<\/label>\n     <input type=\"text\" class=\"form-control\" id=\"name\"\n            required\n            [(ngModel)]=\"model.name\" name=\"name\"\n            #name=\"ngModel\">\n     <div [hidden]=\"name.valid || name.pristine\"\n          class=\"alert alert-danger\">\n       Please enter your name\n     <\/div>\nLet's submit the form with ngSubmit directive and add type=\"submit\" button at the bottom of the form to trigger form submit.\n     html\n     <form (ngSubmit)=\"onSubmit()\" #heroForm=\"ngForm\">\n     \/\/ Form goes here\n     <button type=\"submit\" class=\"btn btn-success\" [disabled]=\"!registerForm.form.valid\">Submit<\/button>\n Finally, the completed template-driven registration form will be appeared as follow.\n html\n <div class=\"container\">\n   <h1>Registration Form<\/h1>\n   <form (ngSubmit)=\"onSubmit()\" #registerForm=\"ngForm\">\n     <div class=\"form-group\">\n       <label for=\"name\">Name<\/label>\n         <input type=\"text\" class=\"form-control\" id=\"name\"\n                required\n                [(ngModel)]=\"model.name\" name=\"name\"\n                #name=\"ngModel\">\n         <div [hidden]=\"name.valid || name.pristine\"\n              class=\"alert alert-danger\">\n           Please enter your name\n         <\/div>\n     <\/div>\n     <button type=\"submit\" class=\"btn btn-success\" [disabled]=\"!registerForm.form.valid\">Submit<\/button>\n     <\/form>\n <\/div>"},{"question":"What are the differences between reactive forms and template driven forms?","answer":"Below are the main differences between reactive forms and template driven forms\n| Feature | Reactive | Template-Driven |\n |---- |---- | --------- |\n | Form model setup | Created(FormControl instance) in component explicitly | Created by directives  |\n | Data updates | Synchronous | Asynchronous |\n | Form custom validation | Defined as Functions | Defined as Directives |\n | Testing | No interaction with change detection cycle | Need knowledge of the change detection process |\n | Mutability | Immutable(by always returning new value for FormControl instance) | Mutable(Property always modified to new value) |\n | Scalability | More scalable using low-level APIs | Less scalable using due to abstraction on APIs|"},{"question":"What are the different ways to group form controls?","answer":"Reactive forms provide two ways of grouping multiple related controls.\n\n\nFormGroup: It defines a form with a fixed set of controls those can be managed together in an one object. It has same properties and methods similar to a FormControl instance.\n    This FormGroup can be nested to create complex forms as below.\n    ```js\n    import { Component } from '@angular\/core';\n    import { FormGroup, FormControl } from '@angular\/forms';\n@Component({\n  selector: 'user-profile',\n  templateUrl: '.\/user-profile.component.html',\n  styleUrls: ['.\/user-profile.component.css']\n})\nexport class UserProfileComponent {\n  userProfile = new FormGroup({\n    firstName: new FormControl(''),\n    lastName: new FormControl(''),\n    address: new FormGroup({\n          street: new FormControl(''),\n          city: new FormControl(''),\n          state: new FormControl(''),\n          zip: new FormControl('')\n        })\n  });\nonSubmit() {\n    \/\/ Store this.userProfile.value in DB\n  }\n}\nhtml\n\n\n    First Name:\n    \n\n\n    Last Name:\n    \n\n\nAddress\n<label>\n  Street:\n  <input type=\"text\" formControlName=\"street\">\n<\/label>\n\n<label>\n  City:\n  <input type=\"text\" formControlName=\"city\">\n<\/label>\n\n<label>\n  State:\n  <input type=\"text\" formControlName=\"state\">\n<\/label>\n\n<label>\n  Zip Code:\n  <input type=\"text\" formControlName=\"zip\">\n<\/label>\n\n\nSubmit\n\n2. **FormArray:** It defines a dynamic form in an array format, where you can add and remove controls at run time. This is useful for dynamic forms when you don\u2019t know how many controls will be present within the group.js\n    import { Component } from '@angular\/core';\n    import { FormArray, FormControl } from '@angular\/forms';\n@Component({\n  selector: 'order-form',\n  templateUrl: '.\/order-form.component.html',\n  styleUrls: ['.\/order-form.component.css']\n})\nexport class OrderFormComponent {\n  constructor () {\n    this.orderForm = new FormGroup({\n      firstName: new FormControl('John', Validators.minLength(3)),\n      lastName: new FormControl('Rodson'),\n      items: new FormArray([\n        new FormControl(null)\n      ])\n    });\n  }\n\n  onSubmitForm () {\n    \/\/ Save the items this.orderForm.value in DB\n  }\n\n  onAddItem () {\n    this.orderForm.controls\n    .items.push(new FormControl(null));\n  }\n\n  onRemoveItem (index) {\n    this.orderForm.controls['items'].removeAt(index);\n  }\n}\n\nhtml\n   \n <label>\n   First Name:\n   <input type=\"text\" formControlName=\"firstName\">\n <\/label>\n\n <label>\n   Last Name:\n   <input type=\"text\" formControlName=\"lastName\">\n <\/label>\n\n <div>\n <p>Add items<\/p>\n <ul formArrayName=\"items\">\n   <li *ngFor=\"let item of orderForm.controls.items.controls; let i = index\">\n     <input type=\"text\" formControlName=\"{{i}}\">\n     <button type=\"button\" title=\"Remove Item\" (click)=\"onRemoveItem(i)\">Remove<\/button>\n   <\/li>\n <\/ul>\n <button type=\"button\" (click)=\"onAddItem\">\n   Add an item\n <\/button>\n<\/div>\n\n```"},{"question":"Address","answer":""},{"question":"How do you update specific properties of a form model?","answer":"You can use `patchValue()` method to update specific properties defined in the form model. For example,you can update the name and street of certain profile on click of the update button as shown below.\n ```js\n updateProfile() {\n   this.userProfile.patchValue({\n     firstName: 'John',\n     address: {\n       street: '98 Crescent Street'\n     }\n   });\n }\n ```\n ```html\n   <button (click)=\"updateProfile()\">Update Profile<\/button>\n ```\nYou can also use setValue method to update properties.Note: Remember to update the properties against the exact model structure."},{"question":"What is the purpose of FormBuilder?","answer":"FormBuilder is used as syntactic sugar for easily creating instances of a FormControl, FormGroup, or FormArray. This is helpful to reduce the amount of boilerplate needed to build complex reactive forms. It is available as an injectable helper class of the `@angular\/forms` package.\nFor example, the user profile component creation becomes easier as shown here.\n js\n export class UserProfileComponent {\n   profileForm = this.formBuilder.group({\n     firstName: [''],\n     lastName: [''],\n     address: this.formBuilder.group({\n       street: [''],\n       city: [''],\n       state: [''],\n       zip: ['']\n     }),\n   });\n   constructor(private formBuilder: FormBuilder) { }\n   }"},{"question":"How do you verify the model changes in forms?","answer":"You can add a getter property(let's say, diagnostic) inside component to return a JSON representation of the model during the development. This is useful to verify whether the values are really flowing from the input box to the model and vice versa or not.\n ```js\n export class UserProfileComponent {\nmodel = new User('John', 29, 'Writer');\/\/ TODO: Remove after the verification\n   get diagnostic() { return JSON.stringify(this.model); }\n }\n and add `diagnostic` binding near the top of the formhtml\n {{diagnostic}}\n \n   \/\/ FormControls goes here\n \n ```"},{"question":"What are the state CSS classes provided by ngModel?","answer":"The ngModel directive updates the form control with special Angular CSS classes to reflect it's state.

Also, these functions passed as second argument while instantiating the form control. The main use cases are simple checks like whether a field is empty, whether it exceeds a maximum length etc.\nAsync validators: These are the asynchronous functions which take a control instance and return a Promise or Observable that later emits a set of validation errors or null. Also, these functions passed as second argument while instantiating the form control. The main use cases are complex validations like hitting a server to check the availability of a username or email.\nThe representation of these validators looks like below\n js\n this.myForm = formBuilder.group({\n     firstName: ['value'],\n     lastName: ['value', *Some Sync validation function*],\n     email: ['value', *Some validation function*, *Some asynchronous validation function*]\n });"},{"question":"Can you give an example of built-in validators?","answer":"In reactive forms, you can use built-in validator like `required` and `minlength` on your input form controls. For example, the registration form can have these validators on name input field\n ```js\n this.registrationForm = new FormGroup({\n     'name': new FormControl(this.hero.name, [\n       Validators.required,\n       Validators.minLength(4),\n     ])\n   });\n ```\n Whereas in template-driven forms, both `required` and `minlength` validators available as attributes."},{"question":"How do you optimize the performance of async validators?","answer":"Since all validators run after every form value change, it creates a major impact on performance with async validators by hitting the external API on each keystroke. This situation can be avoided by delaying the form validity by changing the updateOn property from change (default) to submit or blur.\n The usage would be different based on form types,\n\nTemplate-driven forms: Set the property on ngModelOptions directive\n     html\n     <input [(ngModel)]=\"name\" [ngModelOptions]=\"{updateOn: 'blur'}\">\nReactive-forms: Set the property on FormControl instance\n     js\n     name = new FormControl('', {updateOn: 'blur'});"},{"question":"How to set ngFor and ngIf on the same element?","answer":"Sometimes you may need to both ngFor and ngIf on the same element but unfortunately you are going to encounter below template error.\n ```cmd\n  Template parse errors: Can't have multiple template bindings on one element.\n ```\n  In this case, You need to use either ng-container or ng-template.\n  Let's say if you try to loop over the items only when the items are available, the below code throws an error in the browser\n  ```html\n  <ul *ngIf=\"items\" *ngFor=\"let item of items\">\n    <li><\/li>\n  <\/ul>\n  ```\n  and it can be fixed by\n  ```html\n  <ng-container *ngIf=\"items\">\n    <ul *ngFor=\"let item of items\">\n      <li><\/li>\n    <\/ul>\n  <\/ng-container>\n  ```"},{"question":"What is host property in css?","answer":"The `:host` pseudo-class selector is used to target styles in the element that hosts the component. Since the host element is in a parent component's template, you can't reach the host element from inside the component by other means.\n For example, you can create a border for parent element as below,\n ```js\n \/\/Other styles for app.component.css\n \/\/...\n :host {\n   display: block;\n   border: 1px solid black;\n   padding: 20px;\n }\n ```"},{"question":"How do you get the current route?","answer":"In Angular, there is an `url` property of router package to get the current route.

Remember that JavaScript only hoists declarations, not initialisation.\nLet's take a simple example of variable hoisting,javascript\nconsole.log(message); \/\/output : undefined\nvar message = \"The variable Has been hoisted\";The above code looks like as below to the interpreter,javascript\nvar message;\nconsole.log(message);\nmessage = \"The variable Has been hoisted\";In the same fashion, function declarations are hoisted too```javascript\nmessage(\"Good morning\"); \/\/Good morningfunction message(name) {\n  console.log(name);\n}\n```This hoisting makes functions to be safely used in code before they are declared."},{"question":"What are classes in ES6","answer":"In ES6, Javascript classes are primarily syntactic sugar over JavaScript\u2019s existing prototype-based inheritance.\nFor example, the prototype based inheritance written in function expression as below,```javascript\nfunction Bike(model, color) {\n  this.model = model;\n  this.color = color;\n}Bike.prototype.getDetails = function () {\n  return this.model + \" bike has\" + this.color + \" color\";\n};\n```Whereas ES6 classes can be defined as an alternative```javascript\nclass Bike {\n  constructor(color, model) {\n    this.color = color;\n    this.model = model;\n  }getDetails() {\n    return this.model + \" bike has\" + this.color + \" color\";\n  }\n}\n```"},{"question":"What are closures","answer":"A closure is the combination of a function and the lexical environment within which that function was declared. i.e,\nIt is an inner function that has access to the outer or enclosing function\u2019s variables. The closure has three scope\nchains\nOwn scope where variables defined between its curly brackets\nOuter function\u2019s variables\nGlobal variables\nLet's take an example of closure concept,javascript\nfunction Welcome(name) {\n  var greetingInfo = function (message) {\n    console.log(message + \" \" + name);\n  };\n  return greetingInfo;\n}\nvar myFunction = Welcome(\"John\");\nmyFunction(\"Welcome \"); \/\/Output: Welcome John\nmyFunction(\"Hello Mr.\"); \/\/output: Hello Mr.JohnAs per the above code, the inner function(i.e, greetingInfo) has access to the variables in the outer function\nscope(i.e, Welcome) even after the outer function has returned."},{"question":"What are modules","answer":"Modules refer to small units of independent, reusable code and also act as the foundation of many JavaScript design\npatterns.

Generally, scripts on different pages\nare allowed to access each other if and only if the pages follow same-origin policy(i.e, pages share the same\nprotocol, port number, and host)."},{"question":"What is a Cookie","answer":"A cookie is a piece of data that is stored on your computer to be accessed by your browser. Cookies are saved as\nkey\/value pairs.\nFor example, you can create a cookie named username as below,javascript\ndocument.cookie = \"username=John\";"},{"question":"Why do you need a Cookie","answer":"Cookies are used to remember information about the user profile(such as username). It basically involves two steps,\nWhen a user visits a web page, the user profile can be stored in a cookie.\nNext time the user visits the page, the cookie remembers the user profile."},{"question":"What are the options in a cookie","answer":"There are few below options available for a cookie,\nBy default, the cookie is deleted when the browser is closed but you can change this behavior by setting expiry\n   date (in UTC time).\njavascript\ndocument.cookie = \"username=John; expires=Sat, 8 Jun 2019 12:00:00 UTC\";\nBy default, the cookie belongs to a current page. But you can tell the browser what path the cookie belongs to\n   using a path parameter.\njavascript\ndocument.cookie = \"username=John; path=\/services\";"},{"question":"How do you delete a cookie","answer":"You can delete a cookie by setting the expiry date as a passed date. You don't need to specify a cookie value in\nthis case.\nFor example, you can delete a username cookie in the current page as below.javascript\ndocument.cookie =\n  \"username=; expires=Fri, 07 Jun 2019 00:00:00 UTC; path=\/;\";Note: You should define the cookie path option to ensure that you delete the right cookie.

This iterator object wraps\n each iterated element in an object and returns it via next() method one by one.\n IteratorResult: It is an object returned by next() method. The object contains two properties; the value\n property contains an iterated element and the done property determines whether the element is the last element or\n not.Let's demonstrate synchronous iteration with an array as below,javascript\n const iterable = [\"one\", \"two\", \"three\"];\n const iterator = iterable[Symbol.iterator]();\n console.log(iterator.next()); \/\/ { value: 'one', done: false }\n console.log(iterator.next()); \/\/ { value: 'two', done: false }\n console.log(iterator.next()); \/\/ { value: 'three', done: false }\n console.log(iterator.next()); \/\/ { value: 'undefined, done: true }"},{"question":"What is an event loop","answer":"The event loop is a process that continuously monitors both the call stack and the event queue and checks whether\n or not the call stack is empty. If the call stack is empty and there are pending events in the event queue, the\n event loop dequeues the event from the event queue and pushes it to the call stack. The call stack executes the\n event, and any additional events generated during the execution are added to the end of the event queue.Note: The event loop allows Node.js to perform non-blocking I\/O operations, even though JavaScript is\n single-threaded, by offloading operations to the system kernel whenever possible. Since most modern kernels are\n multi-threaded, they can handle multiple operations executing in the background."},{"question":"What is call stack","answer":"Call Stack is a data structure for javascript interpreters to keep track of function calls(creates execution\n context) in the program. It has two major actions,\nWhenever you call a function for its execution, you are pushing it to the stack.\nWhenever the execution is completed, the function is popped out of the stack.\nLet's take an example and it's state representation in a diagram format```javascript\n function hungry() {\n   eatFruits();\n }\n function eatFruits() {\n   return \"I'm eating fruits\";\n }\/\/ Invoke the hungry function\n hungry();\n ```The above code processed in a call stack as below,\nAdd the hungry() function to the call stack list and execute the code.\nAdd the eatFruits() function to the call stack list and execute the code.\nDelete the eatFruits() function from our call stack list.\nDelete the hungry() function from the call stack list since there are no items anymore."},{"question":"What is an event queue","answer":"The event queue follows the queue data structure. It stores async callbacks to be added to the call stack. It is\n also known as the Callback Queue or Macrotask Queue.Whenever the call stack receives an async function, it is moved into the Web API. Based on the function, Web API\n executes it and awaits the result. Once it is finished, it moves the callback into the event queue (the callback of\n the promise is moved into the microtask queue).The event queue constantly checks whether or not the call stack is empty. Once the call stack is empty and there is\n a callback in the event queue, the event queue moves the callback into the call stack. If there is a callback in\n the microtask queue as well, it is moved first. The microtask queue has a higher priority than the event queue."},{"question":"What is a decorator","answer":"A decorator is an expression that evaluates to a function and that takes the target, name, and decorator descriptor\n as arguments.

So it\n can help reduce file size by reducing the need to repeat a lengthy object reference without performance penalty.\n Let's take an example where it is used to avoid redundancy when accessing an object several times.javascript\n a.b.c.greeting = \"welcome\";\n a.b.c.age = 32;Using with it turns this into:javascript\n with (a.b.c) {\n   greeting = \"welcome\";\n   age = 32;\n }But this with statement creates performance problems since one cannot predict whether an argument will refer to a\n real variable or to a property inside the with argument."},{"question":"What is the output of below for loops","answer":"```javascript\n for (var i = 0; i < 4; i++) {\n   \/\/ global scope\n   setTimeout(() => console.log(i));\n }for (let i = 0; i < 4; i++) {\n   \/\/ block scope\n   setTimeout(() => console.log(i));\n }\n ```The output of the above for loops is 4 4 4 4 and 0 1 2 3Explanation: Due to the event queue\/loop of javascript, the setTimeout callback function is called after the\n loop has been executed. Since the variable i is declared with the var keyword it became a global variable and the\n value was equal to 4 using iteration when the time setTimeout function is invoked. Hence, the output of the first\n loop is 4 4 4 4.Whereas in the second loop, the variable i is declared as the let keyword it becomes a block scoped variable and\n it holds a new value(0, 1 ,2 3) for each iteration. Hence, the output of the first loop is 0 1 2 3."},{"question":"List down some of the features of ES6","answer":"Below are the list of some new features of ES6,\nSupport for constants or immutable variables\nBlock-scope support for variables, constants and functions\nArrow functions\nDefault parameters\nRest and Spread Parameters\nTemplate Literals\nMulti-line Strings\nDestructuring Assignment\nEnhanced Object Literals\nPromises\nClasses\nModules"},{"question":"What is ES6","answer":"ES6 is the sixth edition of the javascript language and it was released in June 2015. It was initially known as\n ECMAScript 6 (ES6) and later renamed to ECMAScript 2015. Almost all the modern browsers support ES6 but for the old\n browsers there are many transpilers, like Babel.js etc."},{"question":"Can I redeclare let and const variables","answer":"No, you cannot redeclare let and const variables. If you do, it throws below errorbash\n Uncaught SyntaxError: Identifier 'someVariable' has already been declaredExplanation: The variable declaration with var keyword refers to a function scope and the variable is treated\n as if it were declared at the top of the enclosing scope due to hoisting feature. So all the multiple declarations\n contributing to the same hoisted variable without any error. Let's take an example of re-declaring variables in the\n same scope for both var and let\/const variables.javascript\n var name = \"John\";\n function myFunc() {\n   var name = \"Nick\";\n   var name = \"Abraham\"; \/\/ Re-assigned in the same function block\n   alert(name); \/\/ Abraham\n }\n myFunc();\n alert(name); \/\/ JohnThe block-scoped multi-declaration throws syntax error,```javascript\n let name = \"John\";\n function myFunc() {\n   let name = \"Nick\";\n   let name = \"Abraham\"; \/\/ Uncaught SyntaxError: Identifier 'name' has already been declared\n   alert(name);\n }myFunc();\n alert(name);\n ```"},{"question":"Is const variable makes the value immutable","answer":"No, the const variable doesn't make the value immutable. But it disallows subsequent assignments(i.e, You can\n declare with assignment but can't assign another value later)javascript\n const userList = [];\n userList.push(\"John\"); \/\/ Can mutate even though it can't re-assign\n console.log(userList); \/\/ ['John']"},{"question":"What are default parameters","answer":"In E5, we need to depend on logical OR operators to handle default values of function parameters. Whereas in ES6,\n Default function parameters feature allows parameters to be initialized with default values if no value or\n undefined is passed. Let's compare the behavior with an examples,```javascript\n \/\/ES5\n var calculateArea = function (height, width) {\n   height = height || 50;\n   width = width || 60;return width * height;\n };\n console.log(calculateArea()); \/\/300\n ```The default parameters makes the initialization more simpler,```javascript\n \/\/ES6\n var calculateArea = function (height = 50, width = 60) {\n   return width * height;\n };console.log(calculateArea()); \/\/300\n ```"},{"question":"What are template literals","answer":"Template literals or template strings are string literals allowing embedded expressions. These are enclosed by the\n back-tick (`) character instead of double or single quotes.\n In E6, this feature enables using dynamic expressions as below,javascript\n var greeting = `Welcome to JS World, Mr. ${firstName} ${lastName}.`;In ES5, you need break string like below,javascript\n var greeting = 'Welcome to JS World, Mr. ' + firstName + ' ' + lastName.`Note: You can use multi-line strings and string interpolation features with template literals."},{"question":"How do you write multi-line strings in template literals","answer":"In ES5, you would have to use newline escape characters('\\n') and concatenation symbols(+) in order to get\n multi-line strings.javascript\n console.log(\"This is string sentence 1\\n\" + \"This is string sentence 2\");Whereas in ES6, You don't need to mention any newline sequence character,javascript\n console.log(`This is string sentence\n 'This is string sentence 2`);"},{"question":"What are nesting templates","answer":"The nesting template is a feature supported within template literals syntax to allow inner backticks inside a\n placeholder ${ } within the template. For example, the below nesting template is used to display the icons based on\n user permissions whereas outer template checks for platform type,javascript\n const iconStyles = `icon ${\n   isMobilePlatform()\n     ? \"\"\n     : `icon-${user.isAuthorized ? \"submit\" : \"disabled\"}`\n }`;You can write the above use case without nesting template features as well. However, the nesting template feature\n is more compact and readable.javascript\n \/\/Without nesting templates\n  const iconStyles = `icon ${ isMobilePlatform() ? '' :\n    user.isAuthorized ? 'icon-submit' : 'icon-disabled'}`;"},{"question":"What are tagged templates","answer":"Tagged templates are the advanced form of templates in which tags allow you to parse template literals with a\n function. The tag function accepts the first parameter as an array of strings and remaining parameters as\n expressions. This function can also return manipulated strings based on parameters. Let's see the usage of this\n tagged template behavior of an IT professional skill set in an organization,```javascript\n var user1 = \"John\";\n var skill1 = \"JavaScript\";\n var experience1 = 15;var user2 = \"Kane\";\n var skill2 = \"JavaScript\";\n var experience2 = 5;function myInfoTag(strings, userExp, experienceExp, skillExp) {\n   var str0 = strings[0]; \/\/ \"Mr\/Ms. \"\n   var str1 = strings[1]; \/\/ \" is a\/an \"\n   var str2 = strings[2]; \/\/ \"in\"var expertiseStr;\n   if (experienceExp > 10) {\n     expertiseStr = \"expert developer\";\n   } else if (skillExp > 5 && skillExp <= 10) {\n     expertiseStr = \"senior developer\";\n   } else {\n     expertiseStr = \"junior developer\";\n   }return ${str0}${userExp}${str1}${expertiseStr}${str2}${skillExp};\n }var output1 = myInfoTagMr\/Ms. ${user1} is a\/an ${experience1} in ${skill1};\n var output2 = myInfoTagMr\/Ms. ${user2} is a\/an ${experience2} in ${skill2};console.log(output1); \/\/ Mr\/Ms. John is a\/an expert developer in JavaScript\n console.log(output2); \/\/ Mr\/Ms. Kane is a\/an junior developer in JavaScript\n ```"},{"question":"What are raw strings","answer":"ES6 provides a raw strings feature using the String.raw() method which is used to get the raw string form of\n template strings. This feature allows you to access the raw strings as they were entered, without processing escape\n sequences. For example, the usage would be as below,javascript\n var calculationString = String.raw`The sum of numbers is \\n${\n   1 + 2 + 3 + 4\n }!`;\n console.log(calculationString); \/\/ The sum of numbers is 10If you don't use raw strings, the newline character sequence will be processed by displaying the output in multiple\n linesjavascript\n var calculationString = `The sum of numbers is \\n${1 + 2 + 3 + 4}!`;\n console.log(calculationString);\n \/\/ The sum of numbers is\n \/\/ 10Also, the raw property is available on the first argument to the tag functionjavascript\n function tag(strings) {\n   console.log(strings.raw[0]);\n }"},{"question":"What is destructuring assignment","answer":"The destructuring assignment is a JavaScript expression that makes it possible to unpack values from arrays or\n properties from objects into distinct variables.\n Let's get the month values from an array using destructuring assignment```javascript\n var [one, two, three] = [\"JAN\", \"FEB\", \"MARCH\"];console.log(one); \/\/ \"JAN\"\n console.log(two); \/\/ \"FEB\"\n console.log(three); \/\/ \"MARCH\"\n ```and you can get user properties of an object using destructuring assignment,```javascript\n var { name, age } = { name: \"John\", age: 32 };console.log(name); \/\/ John\n console.log(age); \/\/ 32\n ```"},{"question":"What are default values in destructuring assignment","answer":"A variable can be assigned a default value when the value unpacked from the array or object is undefined during\n destructuring assignment. It helps to avoid setting default values separately for each assignment. Let's take an\n example for both arrays and object use cases,Arrays destructuring:```javascript\n var x, y, z;[x = 2, y = 4, z = 6] = [10];\n console.log(x); \/\/ 10\n console.log(y); \/\/ 4\n console.log(z); \/\/ 6\n ```Objects destructuring:```javascript\n var { x = 2, y = 4, z = 6 } = { x: 10 };console.log(x); \/\/ 10\n console.log(y); \/\/ 4\n console.log(z); \/\/ 6\n ```"},{"question":"How do you swap variables in destructuring assignment","answer":"If you don't use destructuring assignment, swapping two values requires a temporary variable. Whereas using a\n destructuring feature, two variable values can be swapped in one destructuring expression. Let's swap two number\n variables in array destructuring assignment,```javascript\n var x = 10,\n   y = 20;[x, y] = [y, x];\n console.log(x); \/\/ 20\n console.log(y); \/\/ 10\n ```"},{"question":"What are enhanced object literals","answer":"Object literals make it easy to quickly create objects with properties inside the curly braces. For example, it\n provides shorter syntax for common object property definition as below.javascript\n \/\/ES6\n var x = 10,\n   y = 20;\n obj = { x, y };\n console.log(obj); \/\/ {x: 10, y:20}\n \/\/ES5\n var x = 10,\n   y = 20;\n obj = { x: x, y: y };\n console.log(obj); \/\/ {x: 10, y:20}"},{"question":"What are dynamic imports","answer":"The dynamic imports using import() function syntax allows us to load modules on demand by using promises or the\n async\/await syntax. Currently this feature is\n in stage4 proposal. The main advantage of dynamic imports is\n reduction of our bundle's sizes, the size\/payload response of our requests and overall improvements in the user\n experience.\n The syntax of dynamic imports would be as below,javascript\n import(\".\/Module\").then((Module) => Module.method());"},{"question":"What are the use cases for dynamic imports","answer":"Below are some of the use cases of using dynamic imports over static imports,\nImport a module on-demand or conditionally. For example, if you want to load a polyfill on legacy browser\njavascript\n if (isLegacyBrowser()) {\n     import(\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7)\n     .then(\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7);\n }\nCompute the module specifier at runtime.

Hence, each character of a string becomes an element within an Array."},{"question":"Is PostMessage secure","answer":"Yes, postMessages can be considered very secure as long as the programmer\/developer is careful about checking the\n origin and source of an arriving message. But if you try to send\/receive a message without verifying its source\n will create cross-site scripting attacks."},{"question":"What are the problems with postmessage target origin as wildcard","answer":"The second argument of postMessage method specifies which origin is allowed to receive the message. If you use the\n wildcard \u201c*\u201d as an argument then any origin is allowed to receive the message. In this case, there is no way for\n the sender window to know if the target window is at the target origin when sending the message. If the target\n window has been navigated to another origin, the other origin would receive the data. Hence, this may lead to XSS\n vulnerabilities.javascript\n targetWindow.postMessage(message, \"*\");"},{"question":"How do you avoid receiving postMessages from attackers","answer":"Since the listener listens for any message, an attacker can trick the application by sending a message from the\n attacker\u2019s origin, which gives an impression that the receiver received the message from the actual sender\u2019s\n window. You can avoid this issue by validating the origin of the message on the receiver's end using the\n \u201cmessage.origin\u201d attribute. For examples, let's check the sender's\n origin http:\/\/www.some-sender.com on receiver\n side www.some-receiver.com,javascript\n \/\/Listener on http:\/\/www.some-receiver.com\/\n window.addEventListener(\"message\", function(message){\n     if(\/^http:\/\/www\\.some-sender\\.com$\/.test(message.origin)){\n          console.log('You received the data from valid sender', message.data);\n    }\n });"},{"question":"Can I avoid using postMessages completely","answer":"You cannot avoid using postMessages completely(or 100%).

A new object is created that has an exact copy of the values in the\n original object. If any of the fields of the object are references to other objects, just the reference addresses\n are copied i.e., only the memory address is copied.Examplejavascript\n var empDetails = {\n   name: \"John\",\n   age: 25,\n   expertise: \"Software Developer\",\n };to create a duplicatejavascript\n var empDetailsShallowCopy = empDetails; \/\/Shallow copying!if we change some property value in the duplicate one like this:javascript\n empDetailsShallowCopy.name = \"Johnson\";The above statement will also change the name of empDetails, since we have a shallow copy. That means we're\n losing the original data as well.Deep copy:\n A deep copy copies all fields, and makes copies of dynamically allocated memory pointed to by the fields. A deep\n copy occurs when an object is copied along with the objects to which it refers.Examplejavascript\n var empDetails = {\n   name: \"John\",\n   age: 25,\n   expertise: \"Software Developer\",\n };Create a deep copy by using the properties from the original object into new variablejavascript\n var empDetailsDeepCopy = {\n   name: empDetails.name,\n   age: empDetails.age,\n   expertise: empDetails.expertise,\n };Now if you change empDetailsDeepCopy.name, it will only affect empDetailsDeepCopy & not empDetails"},{"question":"How do you create specific number of copies of a string","answer":"The repeat() method is used to construct and return a new string which contains the specified number of copies of\n the string on which it was called, concatenated together. Remember that this method has been added to the\n ECMAScript 2015 specification.\n Let's take an example of Hello string to repeat it 4 times,javascript\n \"Hello\".repeat(4); \/\/ 'HelloHelloHelloHello'"},{"question":"How do you return all matching strings against a regular expression","answer":"The matchAll() method can be used to return an iterator of all results matching a string against a regular\n expression. For example, the below example returns an array of matching string results against a regular\n expression,```javascript\n let regexp = \/Hello(\\d?))\/g;\n let greeting = \"Hello1Hello2Hello3\";let greetingList = [...greeting.matchAll(regexp)];console.log(greetingList[0]); \/\/Hello1\n console.log(greetingList[1]); \/\/Hello2\n console.log(greetingList[2]); \/\/Hello3\n ```"},{"question":"How do you trim a string at the beginning or ending","answer":"The trim method of string prototype is used to trim on both sides of a string. But if you want to trim especially\n at the beginning or ending of the string then you can use trimStart\/trimLeft and trimEnd\/trimRight methods.\n Let's see an example of these methods on a greeting message,```javascript\n var greeting = \"   Hello, Goodmorning!   \";console.log(greeting); \/\/ \"   Hello, Goodmorning!   \"\n console.log(greeting.trimStart()); \/\/ \"Hello, Goodmorning!   \"\n console.log(greeting.trimLeft()); \/\/ \"Hello, Goodmorning!   \"console.log(greeting.trimEnd()); \/\/ \"   Hello, Goodmorning!\"\n console.log(greeting.trimRight()); \/\/ \"   Hello, Goodmorning!\"\n ```"},{"question":"What is the output of below console statement with unary operator","answer":"Let's take console statement with unary operator as given below,javascript\n console.log(+\"Hello\");The output of the above console log statement returns NaN. Because the element is prefixed by the unary operator\n and the JavaScript interpreter will try to convert that element into a number type. Since the conversion fails, the\n value of the statement results in NaN value."},{"question":"Does javascript uses mixins","answer":"Mixin is a generic object-oriented programming term - is a class containing methods that can be used by other\n classes without a need to inherit from it. In JavaScript we can only inherit from a single object. ie. There can be\n only one [[prototype]] for an object.But sometimes we require to extend more than one, to overcome this we can use Mixin which helps to copy methods to\n the prototype of another class.Say for instance, we've two classes User and CleanRoom.

But Promises have some pitfalls and the biggest one is swallowing\n errors by default.Let's say you expect to print an error to the console for all the below cases,```javascript\n Promise.resolve(\"promised value\").then(function () {\n   throw new Error(\"error\");\n });Promise.reject(\"error value\").catch(function () {\n   throw new Error(\"error\");\n });new Promise(function (resolve, reject) {\n   throw new Error(\"error\");\n });\n ```But there are many modern JavaScript environments that won't print any errors. You can fix this problem in\n different ways,\nAdd catch block at the end of each chain: You can add catch block to the end of each of your promise chains\njavascript\n   Promise.resolve(\"promised value\")\n     .then(function () {\n       throw new Error(\"error\");\n     })\n     .catch(function (error) {\n       console.error(error.stack);\n     });But it is quite difficult to type for each promise chain and verbose too.\nAdd done method: You can replace first solution's then and catch blocks with done method\njavascript\n   Promise.resolve(\"promised value\").done(function () {\n     throw new Error(\"error\");\n   });Let's say you want to fetch data using HTTP and later perform processing on the resulting data asynchronously.\n   You can write done block as below,javascript\n   getDataFromHttp()\n     .then(function (result) {\n       return processDataAsync(result);\n     })\n     .done(function (processed) {\n       displayData(processed);\n     });In future, if the processing library API changed to synchronous then you can remove done block as below,javascript\n   getDataFromHttp().then(function (result) {\n     return displayData(processDataAsync(result));\n   });and then you forgot to add done block to then block leads to silent errors.\nExtend ES6 Promises by Bluebird:\n   Bluebird extends the ES6 Promises API to avoid the issue in the second solution. This library has a \u201cdefault\u201d\n   onRejection handler which will print all errors from rejected Promises to stderr. After installation, you can\n   process unhandled rejections\njavascript\n   Promise.onPossiblyUnhandledRejection(function (error) {\n     throw error;\n   });and discard a rejection, just handle it with an empty catchjavascript\n   Promise.reject(\"error value\").catch(function () {});"},{"question":"What is deno","answer":"Deno is a simple, modern and secure runtime for JavaScript and TypeScript that uses V8 JavaScript engine and the\n Rust programming language."},{"question":"How do you make an object iterable in javascript","answer":"By default, plain objects are not iterable.

JavaScript doesn't have access specifiers similar to other languages(Java, Pythong etc) to\n provide private scope. It uses IIFE (Immediately invoked function expression) to allow for private scopes. i.e, a\n closure that protect variables and methods.\nThe module pattern look like below,```javascript\n  (function() {\n  \/\/ Private variables or functions goes here.return {\n      \/\/ Return public variables or functions here.\n  }})();\n ```Let's see an example of module pattern for an employee with private and public access,```javascript\n const createEmployee = (function () {\n    \/\/ Private\n    const name = \"John\";\n    const department = \"Sales\";\n    const getEmployeeName = () => name;\n    const getDepartmentName = () => department;\/\/ Public\nreturn {\n  name,\n  department,\n  getName: () => getEmployeeName(),\n  getDepartment: () => getDepartmentName(),\n};\n})();console.log(createEmployee.name);\n  console.log(createEmployee.department);\n  console.log(createEmployee.getName());\n  console.log(createEmployee.getDepartment());\n ```Note: It mimic the concepts of classes with private variables and methods."},{"question":"What is Function Composition?","answer":"It is an approach where the result of one function is passed on to the next function, which is passed to another\n until the final function is executed for the final result.\n```javascript\n  \/\/example\n  const double = x => x * 2\n  const square = x => x * xvar output1 = double(2);\n  var output2 = square(output1);\n  console.log(output2);var output_final = square(double(2));\n  console.log(output_final);\n ```"},{"question":"How to use await outside of async function prior to ES2022?","answer":"Prior to ES2022, if you attempted to use an await outside of an async function resulted in a SyntaxError.\njavascript\n await Promise.resolve(console.log('Hello await')); \/\/ SyntaxError: await is only valid in async functionBut you can fix this issue with an alternative IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression) to get access to the\n feature.javascript\n  (async function() {\n    await Promise.resolve(console.log('Hello await')); \/\/ Hello await\n  }());In ES2022, you can write top-level await without writing any hacks.\n javascript\n await Promise.resolve(console.log('Hello await')); \/\/Hello await"},{"question":"Coding Exercise","answer":"1.

But the statement let x = y = 0 declares a\nlocal variable x. Whereas y declared as a global variable accidentally. This statement is equivalent to,javascript\nlet x;\nwindow.y = 0;\nx = window.y;Since the block scoped variable x is undefined outside of the function, the type will be undefined too. Whereas the\nglobal variable y is available outside the function, the value is 0 and type is number.3.

The order of statements follows the below order,\nAt first, the main function is pushed to the stack.\nThen the browser pushes the first statement of the main function( i.e, A's console.log) to the stack, executing and\n   popping out immediately.\nBut setTimeout statement moved to Browser API to apply the delay for callback.\nIn the meantime, C's console.log added to stack, executed and popped out.\nThe callback of setTimeout moved from Browser API to message queue.\nThe main function popped out from stack because there are no statements to execute\nThe callback moved from message queue to the stack since the stack is empty.\nThe console.log for B is added to the stack and display on the console.\n4. What is the output of below equality checkjavascript\nconsole.log(0.1 + 0.2 === 0.3);\n1: false\n2: true\nAnswer: 1This is due to the float point math problem. Since the floating point numbers are encoded in binary format, the addition\noperations on them lead to rounding errors. Hence, the comparison of floating points doesn't give expected results.\nYou can find more details about the explanation here 0.30000000000000004.com\/5.

Normally semicolons are optional in JavaScript. So if there are any statements(in this case,\nreturn) missing semicolon, it is automatically inserted immediately. Hence, the function returned as undefined.Whereas if the opening curly brace is along with the return keyword then the function is going to be returned as\nexpected.javascript\nfunction foo() {\n  return {\n    message: \"Hello World\",\n  };\n}\nconsole.log(foo()); \/\/ {message: \"Hello World\"}7.

So the\nnumber or elements or length of the array won't be changed.\nIf you try to print myChars then you can observe that it doesn't set an undefined value, rather the property is removed\nfrom the array. The newer versions of Chrome use empty instead of undefined to make the difference a bit clearer.8.

The above code snippet has\nduplicate parameters on 1st and 3rd parameters.\nThe value of the first parameter is mapped to the third argument which is passed to the function. Hence, the 3rd\nargument overrides the first parameter.Note: In strict mode, duplicate parameters will throw a Syntax Error.12. What is the output of below codejavascript\nconst printNumbersArrow = (first, second, first) => {\n  console.log(first, second, first);\n};\nprintNumbersArrow(1, 2, 3);\n1: 1, 2, 3\n2: 3, 2, 3\n3: SyntaxError: Duplicate parameter name not allowed in this context\n4: 1, 2, 1\nAnswer: 3Unlike regular functions, the arrow functions doesn't not allow duplicate parameters in either strict or non-strict\nmode. So you can see SyntaxError in the console.13. What is the output of below codejavascript\nconst arrowFunc = () => arguments.length;\nconsole.log(arrowFunc(1, 2, 3));\n1: ReferenceError: arguments is not defined\n2: 3\n3: undefined\n4: null\nAnswer: 1Arrow functions do not have an arguments, super, this, or new.target bindings. So any reference to arguments\nvariable tries to resolve to a binding in a lexically enclosing environment. In this case, the arguments variable is not\ndefined outside of the arrow function. Hence, you will receive a reference error.Where as the normal function provides the number of arguments passed to the functionjavascript\nconst func = function () {\n  return arguments.length;\n};\nconsole.log(func(1, 2, 3));But If you still want to use an arrow function then rest operator on arguments provides the expected argumentsjavascript\nconst arrowFunc = (...args) => args.length;\nconsole.log(arrowFunc(1, 2, 3));14. What is the output of below codejavascript\nconsole.log(String.prototype.trimLeft.name === \"trimLeft\");\nconsole.log(String.prototype.trimLeft.name === \"trimStart\");\n1: True, False\n2: False, True\nAnswer: 2In order to be consistent with functions like String.prototype.padStart, the standard method name for trimming the\nwhitespaces is considered as trimStart. Due to web web compatibility reasons, the old method name 'trimLeft' still\nacts as an alias for 'trimStart'. Hence, the prototype for 'trimLeft' is always 'trimStart'15. What is the output of below codejavascript\nconsole.log(Math.max());\n1: undefined\n2: Infinity\n3: 0\n4: -Infinity\nAnswer: 4-Infinity is the initial comparant because almost every other value is bigger. So when no arguments are provided,\n-Infinity is going to be returned.\nNote: Zero number of arguments is a valid case.16. What is the output of below codejavascript\nconsole.log(10 == [10]);\nconsole.log(10 == [[[[[[[10]]]]]]]);\n1: True, True\n2: True, False\n3: False, False\n4: False, True\nAnswer: 1As per the comparison algorithm in the ECMAScript specification(ECMA-262), the above expression converted into JS as\nbelowjavascript\n10 === Number([10].valueOf().toString()); \/\/ 10So it doesn't matter about number brackets([]) around the number, it is always converted to a number in the expression.17. What is the output of below codejavascript\nconsole.log(10 + \"10\");\nconsole.log(10 - \"10\");\n1: 20, 0\n2: 1010, 0\n3: 1010, 10-10\n4: NaN, NaN\nAnswer: 2The concatenation operator(+) is applicable for both number and string types. So if any operand is string type then both\noperands concatenated as strings. Whereas subtract(-) operator tries to convert the operands as number type.18. What is the output of below codejavascript\nconsole.log([0] == false);\nif ([0]) {\n  console.log(\"I'm True\");\n} else {\n  console.log(\"I'm False\");\n}\n1: True, I'm True\n2: True, I'm False\n3: False, I'm True\n4: False, I'm False\nAnswer: 1In comparison operators, the expression [0] converted to Number([0].valueOf().toString()) which is resolved to false.\nWhereas [0] just becomes a truthy value without any conversion because there is no comparison operator.19. What is the output of below codejavascript\nconsole.log([1, 2] + [3, 4]);\n1: [1,2,3,4]\n2: [1,2][3,4]\n3: SyntaxError\n4: 1,23,4\nAnswer: 4The + operator is not meant or defined for arrays. So it converts arrays into strings and concatenates them.20. What is the output of below code```javascript\nconst numbers = new Set([1, 1, 2, 3, 4]);\nconsole.log(numbers);const browser = new Set(\"Firefox\");\nconsole.log(browser);\n```\n1: {1, 2, 3, 4}, {\"F\", \"i\", \"r\", \"e\", \"f\", \"o\", \"x\"}\n2: {1, 2, 3, 4}, {\"F\", \"i\", \"r\", \"e\", \"o\", \"x\"}\n3: [1, 2, 3, 4], [\"F\", \"i\", \"r\", \"e\", \"o\", \"x\"]\n4: {1, 1, 2, 3, 4}, {\"F\", \"i\", \"r\", \"e\", \"f\", \"o\", \"x\"}\nAnswer: 1Since Set object is a collection of unique values, it won't allow duplicate values in the collection. At the same\ntime, it is case sensitive data structure.21. What is the output of below codejavascript\nconsole.log(NaN === NaN);\n1: True\n2: False\nAnswer: 2JavaScript follows IEEE 754 spec standards. As per this spec, NaNs are never equal for floating-point numbers.22. What is the output of below codejavascript\nlet numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, NaN];\nconsole.log(numbers.indexOf(NaN));\n1: 4\n2: NaN\n3: SyntaxError\n4: -1\nAnswer: 4The indexOf uses strict equality operator(===) internally and NaN === NaN evaluates to false. Since indexOf won't be\nable to find NaN inside an array, it returns -1 always.\nBut you can use Array.prototype.findIndex method to find out the index of NaN in an array or You can\nuse Array.prototype.includes to check if NaN is present in an array or not.```javascript\nlet numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, NaN];\nconsole.log(numbers.findIndex(Number.isNaN)); \/\/ 4console.log(numbers.includes(NaN)); \/\/ true\n```23.

What is the output of below codejavascript\nasync function func() {\n  return 10;\n}\nconsole.log(func());\n1: Promise {\\<fulfilled>: 10}\n2: 10\n3: SyntaxError\n4: Promise {\\<rejected>: 10}\nAnswer: 1Async functions always return a promise. But even if the return value of an async function is not explicitly a promise,\nit will be implicitly wrapped in a promise. The above async function is equivalent to below expression,javascript\nfunction func() {\n  return Promise.resolve(10);\n}26. What is the output of below codejavascript\nasync function func() {\n  await 10;\n}\nconsole.log(func());\n1: Promise {\\<fulfilled>: 10}\n2: 10\n3: SyntaxError\n4: Promise {\\<resolved>: undefined}\nAnswer: 4The await expression returns value 10 with promise resolution and the code after each await expression can be treated as\nexisting in a .then callback. In this case, there is no return expression at the end of the function. Hence, the\ndefault return value of undefined is returned as the resolution of the promise. The above async function is equivalent\nto below expression,javascript\nfunction func() {\n  return Promise.resolve(10).then(() => undefined);\n}27. What is the output of below code```javascript\nfunction delay() {\n  return new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 2000));\n}async function delayedLog(item) {\n  await delay();\n  console.log(item);\n}async function processArray(array) {\n  array.forEach(item => {\n    await delayedLog(item);\n  })\n}processArray([1, 2, 3, 4]);\n```\n1: SyntaxError\n2: 1, 2, 3, 4\n3: 4, 4, 4, 4\n4: 4, 3, 2, 1\nAnswer: 1Even though \u201cprocessArray\u201d is an async function, the anonymous function that we use for forEach is synchronous. If you\nuse await inside a synchronous function then it throws a syntax error.28. What is the output of below code```javascript\nfunction delay() {\n  return new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, 2000));\n}async function delayedLog(item) {\n  await delay();\n  console.log(item);\n}async function process(array) {\n  array.forEach(async (item) => {\n    await delayedLog(item);\n  });\n  console.log(\"Process completed!\");\n}\nprocess([1, 2, 3, 5]);\n```\n1: 1 2 3 5 and Process completed!\n2: 5 5 5 5 and Process completed!\n3: Process completed! and 5 5 5 5\n4: Process completed! and 1 2 3 5\nAnswer: 4The forEach method will not wait until all items are finished but it just runs the tasks and goes next. Hence, the last\nstatement is displayed first followed by a sequence of promise resolutions.But you control the array sequence using for..of loop,javascript\nasync function processArray(array) {\n  for (const item of array) {\n    await delayedLog(item);\n  }\n  console.log(\"Process completed!\");\n}29. What is the output of below codejavascript\nvar set = new Set();\nset.add(\"+0\").add(\"-0\").add(NaN).add(undefined).add(NaN);\nconsole.log(set);\n1: Set(4) {\"+0\", \"-0\", NaN, undefined}\n2: Set(3) {\"+0\", NaN, undefined}\n3: Set(5) {\"+0\", \"-0\", NaN, undefined, NaN}\n4: Set(4) {\"+0\", NaN, undefined, NaN}\nAnswer: 1Set has few exceptions from equality check,\nAll NaN values are equal\nBoth +0 and -0 considered as different values\n30. What is the output of below code```javascript\nconst sym1 = Symbol(\"one\");\nconst sym2 = Symbol(\"one\");const sym3 = Symbol.for(\"two\");\nconst sym4 = Symbol.for(\"two\");console.log(sym1 === sym2, sym3 === sym4);\n```\n1: true, true\n2: true, false\n3: false, true\n4: false, false\nAnswer: 3Symbol follows below conventions,\nEvery symbol value returned from Symbol() is unique irrespective of the optional string.\nSymbol.for() function creates a symbol in a global symbol registry list. But it doesn't necessarily create a new\n   symbol on every call, it checks first if a symbol with the given key is already present in the registry and returns\n   the symbol if it is found. Otherwise a new symbol created in the registry.\nNote: The symbol description is just useful for debugging purposes.31. What is the output of below codejavascript\nconst sym1 = new Symbol(\"one\");\nconsole.log(sym1);\n1: SyntaxError\n2: one\n3: Symbol('one')\n4: Symbol\nAnswer: 1Symbol is a just a standard function and not an object constructor(unlike other primitives new Boolean, new String and\nnew Number). So if you try to call it with the new operator will result in a TypeError32. What is the output of below code```javascript\nlet myNumber = 100;\nlet myString = \"100\";if (!typeof myNumber === \"string\") {\n  console.log(\"It is not a string!\");\n} else {\n  console.log(\"It is a string!\");\n}if (!typeof myString === \"number\") {\n  console.log(\"It is not a number!\");\n} else {\n  console.log(\"It is a number!\");\n}\n```\n1: SyntaxError\n2: It is not a string!, It is not a number!\n3: It is not a string!, It is a number!\n4: It is a string!, It is a number!\nAnswer: 4The return value of typeof myNumber or typeof myString is always a truthy value (either \"number\" or \"string\"). The !\noperator operates on either typeof myNumber or typeof myString, converting them to boolean values. Since the value\nof both !typeof myNumber and !typeof myString is false, the if condition fails, and control goes to else block.To make the ! operator operate on the equality expression, one needs to add parentheses:if (!(typeof myNumber === \"string\"))Or simply use the inequality operator:if (typeof myNumber !== \"string\")33. What is the output of below codejavascript\nconsole.log(\n  JSON.stringify({ myArray: [\"one\", undefined, function () {}, Symbol(\"\")] })\n);\nconsole.log(\n  JSON.stringify({ [Symbol.for(\"one\")]: \"one\" }, [Symbol.for(\"one\")])\n);\n1: {\"myArray\":['one', undefined, {}, Symbol]}, {}\n2: {\"myArray\":['one', null,null,null]}, {}\n3: {\"myArray\":['one', null,null,null]}, \"{ [Symbol.for('one')]: 'one' }, [Symbol.for('one')]\"\n4: {\"myArray\":['one', undefined, function(){}, Symbol('')]}, {}\nAnswer: 2The symbols has below constraints,\nThe undefined, Functions, and Symbols are not valid JSON values. So those values are either omitted (in an object) or\n   changed to null (in an array). Hence, it returns null values for the value array.\nAll Symbol-keyed properties will be completely ignored. Hence it returns an empty object({}).\n34. What is the output of below code```javascript\nclass A {\n  constructor() {\n    console.log(new.target.name);\n  }\n}class B extends A {\n  constructor() {\n    super();\n  }\n}new A();\nnew B();\n```\n1: A, A\n2: A, B\nAnswer: 2Using constructors, new.target refers to the constructor (points to the class definition of class which is\ninitialized) that was directly invoked by new. This also applies to the case if the constructor is in a parent class and\nwas delegated from a child constructor.35. What is the output of below codejavascript\nconst [x, ...y, z] = [1, 2, 3, 4];\nconsole.log(x, y, z);\n1: 1, [2, 3], 4\n2: 1, [2, 3, 4], undefined\n3: 1, [2], 3\n4: SyntaxError\nAnswer: 4It throws a syntax error because the rest element should not have a trailing comma. You should always consider using a\nrest operator as the last element.36. What is the output of below code```javascript\nconst { a: x = 10, b: y = 20 } = { a: 30 };console.log(x);\nconsole.log(y);\n```\n1: 30, 20\n2: 10, 20\n3: 10, undefined\n4: 30, undefined\nAnswer: 1The object property follows below rules,\nThe object properties can be retrieved and assigned to a variable with a different name\nThe property assigned a default value when the retrieved value is undefined\n37. What is the output of below code```javascript\nfunction area({ length = 10, width = 20 }) {\n  console.log(length * width);\n}area();\n```\n1: 200\n2: Error\n3: undefined\n4: 0\nAnswer: 2If you leave out the right-hand side assignment for the destructuring object, the function will look for at least one\nargument to be supplied when invoked. Otherwise you will receive an\nerror Error: Cannot read property 'length' of undefined as mentioned above.You can avoid the error with either of the below changes,\nPass at least an empty object:\n```javascript\nfunction area({ length = 10, width = 20 }) {\n  console.log(length * width);\n}area({});\n```\nAssign default empty object:\n```javascript\nfunction area({ length = 10, width = 20 } = {}) {\n  console.log(length * width);\n}area();\n```38. What is the output of below code```javascript\nconst props = [\n  { id: 1, name: \"John\" },\n  { id: 2, name: \"Jack\" },\n  { id: 3, name: \"Tom\" },\n];const [, , { name }] = props;\nconsole.log(name);\n```\n1: Tom\n2: Error\n3: undefined\n4: John\nAnswer: 1It is possible to combine Array and Object destructuring. In this case, the third element in the array props accessed\nfirst followed by name property in the object.39. What is the output of below code```javascript\nfunction checkType(num = 1) {\n  console.log(typeof num);\n}checkType();\ncheckType(undefined);\ncheckType(\"\");\ncheckType(null);\n```\n1: number, undefined, string, object\n2: undefined, undefined, string, object\n3: number, number, string, object\n4: number, number, number, number\nAnswer: 3If the function argument is set implicitly(not passing argument) or explicitly to undefined, the value of the argument\nis the default parameter. Whereas for other falsy values('' or null), the value of the argument is passed as a\nparameter.Hence, the result of function calls categorized as below,\nThe first two function calls logs number type since the type of default value is number\nThe type of '' and null values are string and object type respectively.\n40. What is the output of below code```javascript\nfunction add(item, items = []) {\n  items.push(item);\n  return items;\n}console.log(add(\"Orange\"));\nconsole.log(add(\"Apple\"));\n```\n1: ['Orange'], ['Orange', 'Apple']\n2: ['Orange'], ['Apple']\nAnswer: 2Since the default argument is evaluated at call time, a new object is created each time the function is called. So in\nthis case, the new array is created and an element pushed to the default empty array.41. What is the output of below code```javascript\nfunction greet(greeting, name, message = greeting + \" \" + name) {\n  console.log([greeting, name, message]);\n}greet(\"Hello\", \"John\");\ngreet(\"Hello\", \"John\", \"Good morning!\");\n```\n1: SyntaxError\n2: ['Hello', 'John', 'Hello John'], ['Hello', 'John', 'Good morning!']\nAnswer: 2Since parameters defined earlier are available to later default parameters, this code snippet doesn't throw any error.42. What is the output of below codejavascript\nfunction outer(f = inner()) {\n  function inner() {\n    return \"Inner\";\n  }\n}\nouter();\n1: ReferenceError\n2: Inner\nAnswer: 1The functions and variables declared in the function body cannot be referred from default value parameter initializers.\nIf you still try to access, it throws a run-time ReferenceError(i.e, inner is not defined).43. What is the output of below code```javascript\nfunction myFun(x, y, ...manyMoreArgs) {\n  console.log(manyMoreArgs);\n}myFun(1, 2, 3, 4, 5);\nmyFun(1, 2);\n```\n1: [3, 4, 5], undefined\n2: SyntaxError\n3: [3, 4, 5], []\n4: [3, 4, 5], [undefined]\nAnswer: 3The rest parameter is used to hold the remaining parameters of a function and it becomes an empty array if the argument\nis not provided.44. What is the output of below codejavascript\nconst obj = { key: \"value\" };\nconst array = [...obj];\nconsole.log(array);\n1: ['key', 'value']\n2: TypeError\n3: []\n4: ['key']\nAnswer: 2Spread syntax can be applied only to iterable objects. By default, Objects are not iterable, but they become iterable\nwhen used in an Array, or with iterating functions such as map(), reduce(), and assign(). If you still try to do it,\nit still throws TypeError: obj is not iterable.45. What is the output of below codejavascript\nfunction* myGenFunc() {\n  yield 1;\n  yield 2;\n  yield 3;\n}\nvar myGenObj = new myGenFunc();\nconsole.log(myGenObj.next().value);\n1: 1\n2: undefined\n3: SyntaxError\n4: TypeError\nAnswer: 4Generators are not constructible type. But if you still proceed to do, there will be an error saying \"TypeError:\nmyGenFunc is not a constructor\"46. What is the output of below code```javascript\nfunction* yieldAndReturn() {\n  yield 1;\n  return 2;\n  yield 3;\n}var myGenObj = yieldAndReturn();\nconsole.log(myGenObj.next());\nconsole.log(myGenObj.next());\nconsole.log(myGenObj.next());\n```\n1: { value: 1, done: false }, { value: 2, done: true }, { value: undefined, done: true }\n2: { value: 1, done: false }, { value: 2, done: false }, { value: undefined, done: true }\n3: { value: 1, done: false }, { value: 2, done: true }, { value: 3, done: true }\n4: { value: 1, done: false }, { value: 2, done: false }, { value: 3, done: true }\nAnswer: 1A return statement in a generator function will make the generator finish. If a value is returned, it will be set as the\nvalue property of the object and done property to true. When a generator is finished, subsequent next() calls return an\nobject of this form: {value: undefined, done: true}.47. What is the output of below code```javascript\nconst myGenerator = (function* () {\n  yield 1;\n  yield 2;\n  yield 3;\n})();\nfor (const value of myGenerator) {\n  console.log(value);\n  break;\n}for (const value of myGenerator) {\n  console.log(value);\n}\n```\n1: 1,2,3 and 1,2,3\n2: 1,2,3 and 4,5,6\n3: 1 and 1\n4: 1\nAnswer: 4The generator should not be re-used once the iterator is closed. i.e, Upon exiting a loop(on completion or using break &\nreturn), the generator is closed and trying to iterate over it again does not yield any more results. Hence, the second\nloop doesn't print any value.48. What is the output of below codejavascript\nconst num = 0o38;\nconsole.log(num);\n1: SyntaxError\n2: 38\nAnswer: 1If you use an invalid number(outside of 0-7 range) in the octal literal, JavaScript will throw a SyntaxError. In ES5, it\ntreats the octal literal as a decimal number.49. What is the output of below code```javascript\nconst squareObj = new Square(10);\nconsole.log(squareObj.area);class Square {\n  constructor(length) {\n    this.length = length;\n  }get area() {\n    return this.length * this.length;\n  }set area(value) {\n    this.area = value;\n  }\n}\n```\n1: 100\n2: ReferenceError\nAnswer: 2Unlike function declarations, class declarations are not hoisted. i.e, First You need to declare your class and then\naccess it, otherwise it will throw a ReferenceError \"Uncaught ReferenceError: Square is not defined\".Note: Class expressions also applies to the same hoisting restrictions of class declarations.50. What is the output of below code```javascript\nfunction Person() {}Person.prototype.walk = function () {\n  return this;\n};Person.run = function () {\n  return this;\n};let user = new Person();\nlet walk = user.walk;\nconsole.log(walk());let run = Person.run;\nconsole.log(run());\n```\n1: undefined, undefined\n2: Person, Person\n3: SyntaxError\n4: Window, Window\nAnswer: 4When a regular or prototype method is called without a value for this, the methods return an initial this value if\nthe value is not undefined. Otherwise global window object will be returned. In our case, the initial this value is\nundefined so both methods return window objects.51. What is the output of below code```javascript\nclass Vehicle {\n  constructor(name) {\n    this.name = name;\n  }start() {\n    console.log(${this.name} vehicle started);\n  }\n}class Car extends Vehicle {\n  start() {\n    console.log(${this.name} car started);\n    super.start();\n  }\n}const car = new Car(\"BMW\");\nconsole.log(car.start());\n```\n1: SyntaxError\n2: BMW vehicle started, BMW car started\n3: BMW car started, BMW vehicle started\n4: BMW car started, BMW car started\nAnswer: 3The super keyword is used to call methods of a superclass. Unlike other languages the super invocation doesn't need to\nbe a first statement. i.e, The statements will be executed in the same order of code.52. What is the output of below codejavascript\nconst USER = { age: 30 };\nUSER.age = 25;\nconsole.log(USER.age);\n1: 30\n2: 25\n3: Uncaught TypeError\n4: SyntaxError\nAnswer: 2Even though we used constant variables, the content of it is an object and the object's contents (e.g properties) can be\naltered. Hence, the change is going to be valid in this case.53. What is the output of below codejavascript\nconsole.log(\"\ud83d\ude42\" === \"\ud83d\ude42\");\n1: false\n2: true\nAnswer: 2Emojis are unicodes and the unicode for smile symbol is \"U+1F642\". The unicode comparision of same emojies is equivalent\nto string comparison. Hence, the output is always true.54. What is the output of below code?javascript\nconsole.log(typeof typeof typeof true);\n1: string\n2: boolean\n3: NaN\n4: number\nAnswer: 1The typeof operator on any primitive returns a string value. So even if you apply the chain of typeof operators on the\nreturn value, it is always string.55. What is the output of below code?```javascript\nlet zero = new Number(0);if (zero) {\n  console.log(\"If\");\n} else {\n  console.log(\"Else\");\n}\n```\n1: If\n2: Else\n3: NaN\n4: SyntaxError\nAnswer: 1\nThe type of operator on new Number always returns object. i.e, typeof new Number(0) --> object.\nObjects are always truthy in if block\nHence the above code block always goes to if section.55. What is the output of below code in non strict mode?```javascript\nlet msg = \"Good morning!!\";msg.name = \"John\";console.log(msg.name);\n```\n1: \"\"\n2: Error\n3: John\n4: Undefined\nAnswer: 4It returns undefined for non-strict mode and returns Error for strict mode. In non-strict mode, the wrapper object is\ngoing to be created and get the mentioned property. But the object get disappeared after accessing the property in next\nline.56. What is the output of below code?```javascript\nlet count = 10;(function innerFunc() {\n  if (count === 10) {\n    let count = 11;\n    console.log(count);\n  }\n  console.log(count);\n})();\n```\n1: 11, 10\n2: 11, 11\n3: 10, 11\n4: 10, 10\nAnswer: 111 and 10 is logged to the console.The innerFunc is a closure which captures the count variable from the outerscope. i.e, 10. But the conditional has\nanother local variable count which overwrites the ourter count variable. So the first console.log displays value 11.\nWhereas the second console.log logs 10 by capturing the count variable from outerscope.57. What is the output of below code ?\n1: console.log(true && 'hi');\n2: console.log(true && 'hi' && 1);\n3: console.log(true && '' && 0);\nAnswer:\n1: hi\n2: 1\n3: ''\nReason : The operator returns the value of the first falsy operand encountered when evaluating from left to right, or\nthe value of the last operand if they are all truthy.Note: Below these values are consider as falsy value\n1: 0\n2: ''\n3: null\n4: undefined\n5: NAN\n58. What is the output of below code ?```javascript\nlet arr = [1, 2, 3];\nlet str = \"1,2,3\";console.log(arr == str);\n```\n1: false\n2: Error\n3: true\nAnswer: 3Arrays have their own implementation of toString method that returns a comma-separated list of elements. So the above\ncode snippet returns true. In order to avoid conversion of array type, we should use === for comparison.59. What is the output of below code?```javascript\ngetMessage();var getMessage = () => {\n  console.log(\"Good morning\");\n};\n```\n1: Good morning\n2: getMessage is not a function\n3: getMessage is not defined\n4: Undefined\nAnswer: 2Hoisting will move variables and functions to be the top of scope. Even though getMessage is an arrow function the above\nfunction will considered as a varible due to it's variable declaration or assignment. So the variables will have\nundefined value in memory phase and throws an error 'getMessage is not a function' at the code execution phase.60. What is the output of below code?```javascript\nlet quickPromise = Promise.resolve();quickPromise.then(() => console.log(\"promise finished\"));console.log(\"program finished\"); \n```\n1: program finished\n2: Cannot predict the order\n3: program finished, promise finished\n4: promise finished, program finished\nAnswer: 3Even though a promise is resolved immediately, it won't be executed immediately because its .then\/catch\/finally\nhandlers or callbacks(aka task) are pushed into the queue. Whenever the JavaScript engine becomes free from the current\nprogram, it pulls a task from the queue and executes it. This is the reason why last statement is printed first before\nthe log of promise handler.Note: We call the above queue as \"MicroTask Queue\"61. What is the output of below code?javascript\nconsole.log('First line')\n['a', 'b', 'c'].forEach((element) => console.log(element))\nconsole.log('Third line')\n1: First line, then print a, b, c in a new line, and finally print Third line as next line\n2: First line, then print a, b, c in a first line, and print Third line as next line\n3:  Missing semi-colon error\n4:  Cannot read properties of undefined\nAnswer: 4When JavaScript encounters a line break without a semicolon, the JavaScript parser will automatically add a semicolon\nbased on a set of rules called Automatic Semicolon Insertion which determines whether line break as end of statement\nor not to insert semicolon. But it does not assume a semicolon before square brackets [...]. So the first two lines\nconsidered as a single statement as below.javascript\nconsole.log('First line')['a', 'b', 'c'].forEach((element) => console.log(element))Hence, there will be cannot read properties of undefined error while applying the array square bracket on log\nfunction.62. Write a function that returns a random HEX colorSolution 1 (Iterative generation)\n\n\n```javascript\nconst HEX_ALPHABET = [\"0\", \"1\", \"2\", \"3\", \"4\", \"5\", \"6\", \"7\", \"8\", \"9\", \"a\", \"b\", \"c\", \"d\", \"e\", \"f\"];\nconst HEX_PREFIX = \"#\";\nconst HEX_LENGTH = 6;\n\nfunction generateRandomHex() {\n    let randomHex = \"\";\n\n    for(let i = 0; i < HEX_LENGTH; i++) {\n        const randomIndex = Math.floor(Math.random() * HEX_ALPHABET.length);\n        randomHex += HEX_ALPHABET[randomIndex];\n    }\n\n    return HEX_PREFIX + randomHex;\n}\n\n```\n\nSolution 2 (One-liner)\n\n\n```javascript \nconst HEX_PREFIX = \"#\";\nconst HEX_RADIX = 16;\nconst HEX_LENGTH = 6;\n\nfunction generateRandomHex() {\n    return HEX_PREFIX + Math.floor(Math.random() * 0xffffff).toString(HEX_RADIX).padStart(HEX_LENGTH, \"0\");\n} \n```\n\n---\n\n#### 63. What is the output of below code?\n\n```javascript\nvar of = ['of'];\nfor(var of of of) {\n  console.log(of);\n}\n```\n\n- 1:  of\n- 2:  SyntaxError: Unexpected token of\n- 3:  SyntaxError: Identifier 'of' has already been declared\n- 4:  ReferenceError: of is not defined\n\n##### Answer: 1\n\nIn JavaScript, `of` is not considered as a reserved keyword. So the variable declaration with `of` is accepted and\nprints the array value `of` using for..of loop.\n\nBut if you use reserved keyword such as `in` then there will be a syntax error\nsaying `SyntaxError: Unexpected token in`,\n\n```javascript\nvar in = ['in'];\nfor(var in in in) {\n  console.log(in[in]);\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n#### 64. What is the output of below code?\n\n```javascript\nconst numbers = [11, 25, 31, 23, 33, 18, 200];\nnumbers.sort();\nconsole.log(numbers);\n```\n\n- 1:  [11, 18, 23, 25, 31, 33, 200]\n- 2:  [11, 18, 200, 23, 25, 31, 33]\n- 3:  [11, 25, 31, 23, 33, 18, 200]\n- 4:  Cannot sort numbers\n\n##### Answer: 2\n\nBy default, the sort method sorts elements alphabetically. This is because elemented converted to strings and strings\ncompared in UTF-16 code units order. Hence, you will see the above numbers not sorted as expected. In order to sort\nnumerically just supply a comparator function which handles numeric sorts.\n\n```javascript\nconst numbers = [11, 25, 31, 23, 33, 18, 200];\nnumbers.sort((a, b) => a - b);\nconsole.log(numbers);\n```\n\n**Note:** Sort() method changes the original array.\n\n---\n\n#### 65. What is the output order of below code?\n\n```javascript\nsetTimeout(() => {console.log('1')}, 0);\nPromise.resolve('hello').then(() => console.log('2'));\nconsole.log('3');\n```\n\n- 1:  1, 2, 3\n- 2:  1, 3, 2\n- 3:  3, 1, 2\n- 4:  3, 2, 1\n\n##### Answer: 4\n\nWhen the JavaScript engine parses the above code, the first two statements are asynchronous which will be executed later\nand third statement is synchronous statement which will be moved to callstack, executed and prints the number 3 in the\nconsole. Next, Promise is native in ES6 and it will be moved to Job queue which has high priority than callback queue in\nthe execution order. At last, since setTimeout is part of WebAPI the callback function moved to callback queue and\nexecuted. Hence, you will see number 2 printed first followed by 1.\n\n---\n\n#### 66. What is the output of below code?\n\n```javascript\nconsole.log(name);\nconsole.log(message());\nvar name = 'John';\n(function message() {\n   console.log('Hello John: Welcome');\n});\n```\n\n- 1:  John, Hello John: Welcome\n- 2:  undefined, Hello John, Welcome\n- 3:  Reference error: name is not defined, Reference error: message is not defined\n- 4:  undefined, Reference error: message is not defined\n\n##### Answer: 4\n\nIIFE(Immediately Invoked Function Expression) is just like any other function expression which won't be hoisted. Hence,\nthere will be a reference error for message call.\nThe behavior would be the same with below function expression of message1,\n\n```javascript\nconsole.log(name);\nconsole.log(message());\nvar name = 'John';\nvar message = function () {\n   console.log('Hello John: Welcome');\n});\n```\n\n---\n\n#### 67. What is the output of below code?\n\n```javascript\nmessage()\n\nfunction message() {\n  console.log(\"Hello\");\n}\nfunction message() {\n  console.log(\"Bye\");\n}\n```\n\n- 1:  Reference error: message is not defined\n- 2:  Hello\n- 3:  Bye\n- 4:  Compile time error\n\n##### Answer: 3\n\nAs part of hoisting, initially JavaScript Engine or compiler will store first function in heap memory but later rewrite\nor replaces with redefined function content.\n\n---\n\n#### 68. What is the output of below code?\n\n```javascript\nvar currentCity = \"NewYork\";\n\nvar changeCurrentCity = function() {\n  console.log('Current City:', currentCity);\n  var currentCity = \"Singapore\";\n  console.log('Current City:', currentCity);\n}\n\nchangeCurrentCity();\n```\n\n- 1:  NewYork, Singapore\n- 2:  NewYork, NewYork\n- 3:  undefined, Singapore\n- 4:  Singapore, Singapore\n\n##### Answer: 3\n\nDue to hositing feature, the variables declared with `var` will have `undefined` value in the creation phase so the\nouter variable `currentCity` will get same `undefined` value. But after few lines of code JavaScript engine found a new\nfunction call(`changeCurrentCity()`) to update the current city with `var` re-declaration. Since each function call will\ncreate a new execution context, the same variable will have `undefined` value before the declaration and new\nvalue(`Singapore`) after the declarion. Hence, the value `undefined` print first followed by new value `Singapore` in\nthe execution phase.\n\n---\n\n#### 69. What is the output of below code in an order?\n\n```javascript\nfunction second() {\n    var message;\n  console.log(message);\n}\n\nfunction first() {\n    var message=\"first\";\n  second();\n  console.log(message);\n}\n\nvar message = \"default\";\nfirst();\nconsole.log(message);\n```\n\n- 1:  undefined, first, default\n- 2:  default, default, default\n- 3:  first, first, default\n- 4:  undefined, undefined, undefined\n\n##### Answer: 1\n\nEach context(global or functional) has it's own variable environment and the callstack of variables in a LIFO order. So\nyou can see the message variable value from second, first functions in an order followed by global context message\nvariable value at the end.\n\n---\n\n#### 70. What is the output of below code?\n\n```javascript\nvar expressionOne = function functionOne() {\n  console.log(\"functionOne\");\n}\nfunctionOne();\n```\n\n- 1:  functionOne is not defined\n- 2:  functionOne\n- 3:  console.log(\"functionOne\")\n- 4:  undefined\n\n##### Answer: 1\n\nThe function call `functionOne` is not going to be part of scope chain and it has it's own execution context with the\nenclosed variable environment. i.e, It won't be accessed from global context. Hence, there will be an error while\ninvoking the function as `functionOne is not defined`.\n\n---\n\n#### 71. What is the output of below code?\n\n```javascript\nconst user = {\n  name: 'John',\n  eat() {\n    console.log(this);\n    var eatFruit = function() {\n      console.log(this);\n    }\n    eatFruit()\n  }\n}\nuser.eat();\n```\n\n- 1:  {name: \"John\", eat: f}, {name: \"John\", eat: f}\n- 2:  Window {...}, Window {...}\n- 3:  {name: \"John\", eat: f}, undefined\n- 4:  {name: \"John\", eat: f}, Window {...}\n\n##### Answer: 4\n\n`this` keyword is dynamic scoped but not lexically scoped . In other words, it doesn't matter where `this` has been\nwritten but how it has been invoked really matter. In the above code snippet, the `user` object invokes `eat` function\nso `this` keyword refers to `user` object but `eatFruit` has been invoked by `eat` function and `this` will have\ndefault `Window` object.\n\nThe above pit fall fixed by three ways,\n\n1. In ES6, the arrow function will make `this` keyword as lexically scoped. Since the surrounding object of `this`\n   object is `user` object, the `eatFruit` function will contain `user` object for `this` object.\n\n```javascript\nconst user = {\n  name: 'John',\n  eat() {\n    console.log(this);\n    var eatFruit = () => {\n      console.log(this);\n    }\n    eatFruit()\n  }\n}\nuser.eat();\n```\n\nThe next two solutions have been used before ES6 introduced.\n\n2. It is possible create a reference of `this` into a separate variable and use that new variable inplace of `this`\n   keyword inside `eatFruit` function. This is a common practice in jQuery and AngularJS before ES6 introduced.\n\n```javascript\nconst user = {\n  name: 'John',\n  eat() {\n    console.log(this);\n    var self = this;\n    var eatFruit = () => {\n      console.log(self);\n    }\n    eatFruit()\n  }\n}\nuser.eat();\n```\n\n3. The `eatFruit` function can bind explicitly with `this` keyword where it refers `Window` object.\n\n```javascript\nconst user = {\n  name: 'John',\n  eat() {\n    console.log(this);\n    var eatFruit = function() {\n      console.log(this);\n    }\n    return eatFruit.bind(this)\n  }\n}\nuser.eat()();\n```\n\n---\n\n#### 72. What is the output of below code?\n\n```javascript\nlet message = 'Hello World!';\nmessage[0] = 'J';\nconsole.log(message)\n\nlet name = 'John';\nname = name + ' Smith';\nconsole.log(name);\n```\n\n- 1:  Jello World!, John Smith\n- 2:  Jello World!, John\n- 3:  Hello World!, John Smith\n- 4:  Hello World!, John\n\n##### Answer: 3\n\nIn JavaScript, primitives are immutable i.e. there is no way to change a primitive value once it gets created. So when\nyou try to update the string's first character, there is no change in the string value and prints the same initial\nvalue `Hello World!`. Whereas in the later example, the concatenated value is re-assigned to the same variable which\nwill result into creation of new memory block with the reference pointing to `John Smith` value and the old memory block\nvalue(`John`) will be garbage collected.\n\n---\n\n#### 73. What is the output of below code?\n\n```javascript\nlet user1 = { \n      name : 'Jacob',\n      age : 28\n    };\n\nlet user2 = {    \n      name : 'Jacob',\n      age : 28\n    };\n\nconsole.log(user1 === user2);\n```\n\n- 1:  True\n- 2:  False\n- 3:  Compile time error\n\n##### Answer: 2\n\nIn JavaScript, the variables such as objects, arrays and functions comes under pass by reference. When you try to\ncompare two objects with same content, it is going to compare memory address or reference of those variables. These\nvariables always create separate memory blocks hence the comparison is always going to return false value.\n\n---\n\n#### 74. What is the output of below code?\n\n```javascript\nfunction greeting() {\n  setTimeout(function() {\n    console.log(message);\n  }, 5000);\n  const message = \"Hello, Good morning\";\n}\ngreeting();\n```\n\n- 1:  Undefined\n- 2:  Reference error:\n- 3:  Hello, Good morning\n- 4:  null\n\n##### Answer: 3\n\nThe variable `message` is still treated as closure(since it has been used in inner function) eventhough it has been\ndeclared after setTimeout function. The function with in setTimeout function will be sent to WebAPI and the variable\ndeclaration executed with in 5 seconds with the assigned value. Hence, the text declared for the variable will be\ndisplayed.\n\n---\n\n#### 75. What is the output of below code?\n\n```javascript\nconst a = new Number(10);\nconst b = 10;\nconsole.log(a === b);\n```\n\n- 1:  False\n- 2:  True\n\n##### Answer: 1\n\nEventhough both variables `a` and `b` refer a number value, the first declaration is based on constructor function and\nthe type of the variable is going to be `object` type. Whereas the second declaration is primitive assignment with a\nnumber and the type is `number` type. Hence, the equality operator `===` will output `false` value.\n\n---\n\n#### 76. What is the type of below function?\n\n```javascript\nfunction add(a, b) {\n  console.log(\"The input arguments are: \", a, b);\n  return a + b;\n}\n```\n\n- 1:  Pure function\n- 2:  Impure function\n\n##### Answer: 2\n\nEventhough the above function returns the same result for the same arguments(input) that are passed in the function,\nthe `console.log()` statement causes a function to have side effects because it affects the state of an external code.\ni.e, the `console` object's state and depends on it to perform the job. Hence, the above function considered as impure\nfunction.\n\n---\n\n#### 77. What is the output of below code?\n\n```javascript\nconst promiseOne = new Promise((resolve, reject) => setTimeout(resolve, 4000));\nconst promiseTwo = new Promise((resolve, reject) => setTimeout(reject, 4000));\n\nPromise.all([promiseOne, promiseTwo]).then(data => console.log(data));\n```\n\n- 1:  [{status: \"fullfilled\", value: undefined}, {status: \"rejected\", reason: undefined}]\n- 2:  [{status: \"fullfilled\", value: undefined}, Uncaught(in promise)]\n- 3:  Uncaught (in promise)\n- 4:  [Uncaught(in promise), Uncaught(in promise)]\n\n##### Answer: 3\n\nThe above promises settled at the same time but one of them resolved and other one rejected. When you use `.all` method\non these promises, the result will be short circuted by throwing an error due to rejection in second promise. But If you\nuse `.allSettled` method then result of both the promises will be returned irrespective of resolved or rejected promise\nstatus without throwing any error.\n\n```javascript\nPromise.allSettled([promiseOne, promiseTwo]).then(data => console.log(data));\n```\n\n---\n\n#### 78. What is the output of below code?\n\n```javascript\ntry {\n  setTimeout(() => {\n    console.log('try block');\n    throw new Error(`An exception is thrown`)\n  }, 1000);\n} catch(err) {\n  console.log('Error: ', err);\n}\n```\n\n- 1:  try block, Error: An exception is thrown\n- 2:  Error: An exception is thrown\n- 3:  try block, Uncaught Error: Exception is thrown\n- 4:  Uncaught Error: Exception is thrown\n\n##### Answer: 3\n\nIf you put `setTimeout` and `setInterval` methods inside the try clause and an exception is thrown, the catch clause\nwill not catch any of them. This is because the try...catch statement works synchronously, and the function in the above\ncode is executed asynchronously after a certain period of time. Hence, you will see runtime exception without catching\nthe error. To resolve this issue, you have to put the try...catch block inside the function as below,\n\n```javascript\nsetTimeout(() => {\n   try {\n      console.log('try block');\n      throw new Error(`An exception is thrown`)\n   } catch(err) {\n      console.log('Error: ', err);\n   }\n\n  }, 1000);\n```\n\nYou can use `.catch()` function in promises to avoid these issues with asynchronous code."},{"question":"What is React?","answer":"React(aka React.js or ReactJS) is an open-source front-end JavaScript library that is used for building composable user interfaces, especially for single-page applications. It is used for handling view layer for web and mobile apps based on components in a declarative approach. React was created by Jordan Walke, a software engineer working for Facebook. React was first deployed on Facebook's News Feed in 2011 and on Instagram in 2012."},{"question":"What is the history behind React evolution?","answer":"The history of ReactJS started in 2010 with the creation of **XHP**. XHP is a PHP extension which improved the syntax of the language such that XML document fragments become valid PHP expressions and the primary purpose was used to create custom and reusable HTML elements.\nThe main principle of this extension was to make front-end code easier to understand and to help avoid cross-site scripting attacks. The project was successful to prevent the malicious content submitted by the scrubbing user.But there was a different problem with XHP in which dynamic web applications require many roundtrips to the server, and XHP did not solve this problem. Also, the whole UI was re-rendered for small change in the application. Later, the initial prototype of React is created with the name FaxJ by Jordan inspired from XHP. Finally after sometime React has been introduced as a new library into JavaScript world.Note: JSX comes from the idea of XHP\n\nWhat are the major features of React?\n\nThe major features of React are:\nUses JSX syntax, a syntax extension of JS that allows developers to write HTML in their JS code.\nIt uses Virtual DOM instead of Real DOM considering that Real DOM manipulations are expensive.\nSupports server-side rendering which is useful for Search Engine Optimizations(SEO).\nFollows Unidirectional or one-way data flow or data binding.\n\nUses reusable\/composable UI components to develop the view.\n\n\nWhat is JSX?\n\nJSX stands for JavaScript XML and it is an XML-like syntax extension to ECMAScript. Basically it just provides the syntactic sugar for the React.createElement(type, props, ...children) function, giving us expressiveness of JavaScript along with HTML like template syntax.In the example below, the text inside <h1> tag is returned as JavaScript function to the render function.jsx harmony\nexport default function App() {\n  return (\n      <h1 className=\"greeting\">{\"Hello, this is a JSX Code!\"}<\/h1>\n  );\n}\nIf you don't use JSX syntax then the respective JavaScript code should be written as below,```javascript\nimport { createElement } from 'react';export default function App() {\n  return createElement(\n    'h1',\n    { className: 'greeting' },\n    'Hello, this is a JSX Code!'\n  );\n}\n```See Class\n\njsx harmony\nclass App extends React.Component {\n  render() {\n    return (\n        <h1 className=\"greeting\">{\"Hello, this is a JSX Code!\"}<\/h1>\n    );\n  }\n}\n\nNote: JSX is stricter than HTML\n\nWhat is the difference between Element and Component?\n\nAn Element is a plain object describing what you want to appear on the screen in terms of the DOM nodes or other components. Elements can contain other Elements in their props. Creating a React element is cheap. Once an element is created, it cannot be mutated.The JavaScript representation(Without JSX) of React Element would be as follows:javascript\nconst element = React.createElement(\"div\", { id: \"login-btn\" }, \"Login\");\nand this element can be simiplified using JSXhtml\n  <div id=\"login-btn\">Login<\/div>The above React.createElement() function returns an object as below:{\n  type: 'div',\n  props: {\n    children: 'Login',\n    id: 'login-btn'\n  }\n}Finally, this element renders to the DOM using ReactDOM.render().Whereas a component can be declared in several different ways. It can be a class with a render() method or it can be defined as a function. In either case, it takes props as an input, and returns a JSX tree as the output:javascript\nconst Button = ({ handleLogin }) => (\n  <div id={\"login-btn\"} onClick={handleLogin}>\n    Login\n  <\/div>\n);Then JSX gets transpiled to a React.createElement() function tree:javascript\nconst Button = ({ handleLogin }) =>\n  React.createElement(\n    \"div\",\n    { id: \"login-btn\", onClick: handleLogin },\n    \"Login\"\n  );\n\nHow to create components in React?\n\nComponents are the building blocks of creating User Interfaces(UI) in React. There are two possible ways to create a component.\nFunction Components: This is the simplest way to create a component. Those are pure JavaScript functions that accept props object as the first parameter and return React elements to render the output:\njsx harmony\n   function Greeting({ message }) {\n     return <h1>{`Hello, ${message}`}<\/h1>;\n   }\nClass Components: You can also use ES6 class to define a component. The above function component can be written as a class component:\njsx harmony\n   class Greeting extends React.Component {\n     render() {\n       return <h1>{`Hello, ${this.props.message}`}<\/h1>;\n     }\n   }\n\nWhen to use a Class Component over a Function Component?\n\nAfter the addition of Hooks(i.e. React 16.8 onwards) it is always recommended to use Function components over Class components  in React. Because you could use state, lifecycle methods and other features that were only available in class component present in function component too. But even there are two reasons to use Class components over Function components.\nIf you need a React functionality whose Function component equivalent is not present yet, like Error Boundaries. \nIn older versions, If the component needs state or lifecycle methods then you need to use class component.\nNote: You can also use reusable react error boundary third-party component without writing any class. i.e, No need to use class components for Error boundaries.The usage of Error boundaries from the above library is quite straight forward.```jsx\n\"use client\";import { ErrorBoundary } from \"react-error-boundary\";Something went wrong\\}>\n  \n\n```\n\nWhat are Pure Components?\n\nPure components are the components which render the same output for the same state and props. In function components, you can achieve these pure components through memoized React.memo() API wrapping around the component. This API prevents unnecessary re-renders by comparing the previous props and new props using shallow comparison. So it will be helpful for performance optimizations. But at the same time, it won't compare the previous state with the current state because function component itself prevents the unnecessary rendering by default when you set the same state again.The syntactic representation of memoized components looks like below,jsx\nconst MemoizedComponent = memo(SomeComponent, arePropsEqual?);Below is the example of how child component(i.e., EmployeeProfile) prevents re-renders for the same props passed by parent component(i.e.,EmployeeRegForm).```jsx\n  import { memo, useState } from 'react';const EmployeeProfile = memo(function EmployeeProfile({ name, email }) {\n    return (<>\n          Name:{name}\nEmail: {email}\n          );\n  });\n  export default function EmployeeRegForm() {\n    const [name, setName] = useState('');\n    const [email, setEmail] = useState('');\n    return (\n      <>\n        \n          Name:  setName(e.target.value)} \/>\n        \n\n          Email:  setEmail(e.target.value)} \/>\n        \n\n\n\n    );\n  }\n```\nIn the above code, the email prop has not been passed to child component. So there won't be any re-renders for email prop change.In class components, the components extending React.PureComponent instead of  React.Component become the pure components. When props or state changes, PureComponent will do a shallow comparison on both props and state by invoking shouldComponentUpdate() lifecycle method. Note: React.memo() is a higher-order component.\n\nWhat is state in React?\n\nState of a component is an object that holds some information that may change over the lifetime of the component. The important point is whenever the state object changes, the component re-renders. It is always recommended to make our state as simple as possible and minimize the number of stateful components.Let's take an example of User component with message state. Here, useState hook has been used to add state to the User component and it returns an array with current state and function to update it.```jsx harmony\nimport React, { useState } from \"react\";function User() {\n  const [message, setMessage] = useState(\"Welcome to React world\");return (\n    \n{message}\n\n  );\n}\n```See Class\n\n```jsx harmony\nimport React from 'react';\nclass User extends React.Component {\n  constructor(props) {\n    super(props);\nthis.state = {\n  message: \"Welcome to React world\",\n};\n\n}\nrender() {\n    return (\n      \n{this.state.message}\n\n    );\n  }\n}\n```\n\nState is similar to props, but it is private and fully controlled by the component ,i.e., it is not accessible to any other component till the owner component decides to pass it.\n\nWhat are props in React?\n\nProps are inputs to components. They are single values or objects containing a set of values that are passed to components on creation similar to HTML-tag attributes. Here, the data is passed down from a parent component to a child component.The primary purpose of props in React is to provide following component functionality:\nPass custom data to your component.\nTrigger state changes.\nUse via this.props.reactProp inside component's render() method.\nFor example, let us create an element with reactProp property:jsx harmony\n<Element reactProp={\"1\"} \/>This reactProp (or whatever you came up with) attribute name then becomes a property attached to React's native props object which originally already exists on all components created using React library.jsx harmony\nprops.reactPropFor example, the usage of props in function component looks like below:```jsx\nimport React from \"react\";\nimport ReactDOM from \"react-dom\";const ChildComponent = (props) => {\n  return (\n    \n{props.name}\n{props.age}\n\n  );\n};const ParentComponent = () => {\n  return (\n    \n\n\n\n  );\n};\n```"},{"question":"What are the major features of React?","answer":""},{"question":"What is JSX?","answer":""},{"question":"What is the difference between Element and Component?","answer":""},{"question":"How to create components in React?","answer":""},{"question":"When to use a Class Component over a Function Component?","answer":""},{"question":"What are Pure Components?","answer":""},{"question":"What is state in React?","answer":""},{"question":"What are props in React?","answer":""},{"question":"What is the difference between state and props?","answer":"In React, both state and props are plain JavaScript objects and used to manage the data of a component, but they are used in different ways and have different characteristics.\nstate is managed by the component itself and can be updated using the setState() function. Unlike props, state can be modified by the component and is used to manage the internal state of the component. Changes in the state trigger a re-render of the component and its children.\nprops (short for \"properties\") are passed to a component by its parent component and are read-only, meaning that they cannot be modified by the component itself. props can be used to configure the behavior of a component and to pass data between components."},{"question":"Why should we not update the state directly?","answer":"If you try to update the state directly then it won't re-render the component.javascript\n\/\/Wrong\nthis.state.message = \"Hello world\";Instead use setState() method. It schedules an update to a component's state object. When state changes, the component responds by re-rendering.javascript\n\/\/Correct\nthis.setState({ message: \"Hello World\" });Note: You can directly assign to the state object either in constructor or using latest javascript's class field declaration syntax."},{"question":"What is the purpose of callback function as an argument of setState()?","answer":"The callback function is invoked when setState finished and the component gets rendered. Since setState() is asynchronous the callback function is used for any post action.Note: It is recommended to use lifecycle method rather than this callback function.javascript\nsetState({ name: \"John\" }, () =>\n  console.log(\"The name has updated and component re-rendered\")\n);"},{"question":"What is the difference between HTML and React event handling?","answer":"Below are some of the main differences between HTML and React event handling,\nIn HTML, the event name usually represents in lowercase as a convention:\nhtml\n   <button onclick=\"activateLasers()\"><\/button>Whereas in React it follows camelCase convention:jsx harmony\n   <button onClick={activateLasers}>\nIn HTML, you can return false to prevent default behavior:\nhtml\n   <a\n     href=\"#\"\n     onclick='console.log(\"The link was clicked.\"); return false;'\n   \/>Whereas in React you must call preventDefault() explicitly:javascript\n   function handleClick(event) {\n     event.preventDefault();\n     console.log(\"The link was clicked.\");\n   }\nIn HTML, you need to invoke the function by appending ()\n   Whereas in react you should not append () with the function name. (refer \"activateLasers\" function in the first point for example)"},{"question":"How to bind methods or event handlers in JSX callbacks?","answer":"There are 3 possible ways to achieve this in class components:\nBinding in Constructor: In JavaScript classes, the methods are not bound by default. The same rule applies for React event handlers defined as class methods. Normally we bind them in constructor.\njavascript\n   class User extends Component {\n     constructor(props) {\n       super(props);\n       this.handleClick = this.handleClick.bind(this);\n     }\n     handleClick() {\n       console.log(\"SingOut triggered\");\n     }\n     render() {\n       return <button onClick={this.handleClick}>SingOut<\/button>;\n     }\n   }\nPublic class fields syntax: If you don't like to use bind approach then public class fields syntax can be used to correctly bind callbacks. The Create React App eanables this syntax by default.\njsx harmony\n   handleClick = () => {\n     console.log(\"SingOut triggered\", this);\n   };jsx harmony\n   <button onClick={this.handleClick}>SingOut<\/button>\nArrow functions in callbacks: It is possible to use arrow functions directly in the callbacks.\njsx harmony\n   handleClick() {\n       console.log('SingOut triggered');\n   }\n   render() {\n       return <button onClick={() => this.handleClick()}>SignOut<\/button>;\n   }Note: If the callback is passed as prop to child components, those components might do an extra re-rendering. In those cases, it is preferred to go with .bind() or public class fields syntax approach considering performance."},{"question":"How to pass a parameter to an event handler or callback?","answer":"You can use an arrow function to wrap around an event handler and pass parameters:jsx harmony\n<button onClick={() => this.handleClick(id)} \/>This is an equivalent to calling .bind:jsx harmony\n<button onClick={this.handleClick.bind(this, id)} \/>Apart from these two approaches, you can also pass arguments to a function which is defined as arrow functionjsx harmony\n<button onClick={this.handleClick(id)} \/>;\nhandleClick = (id) => () => {\n  console.log(\"Hello, your ticket number is\", id);\n};"},{"question":"What are synthetic events in React?","answer":"SyntheticEvent is a cross-browser wrapper around the browser's native event. Its API is same as the browser's native event, including stopPropagation() and preventDefault(), except the events work identically across all browsers. The native events can be accessed directly from synthetic events using nativeEvent attribute.Let's take an example of BookStore title search component with the ability to get all native event properties```js\nfunction BookStore() {\n  handleTitleChange(e) {\n    console.log('The new title is:', e.target.value);\n    \/\/ 'e' represents synthetic event\n    const nativeEvent = e.nativeEvent;\n    console.log(nativeEvent);\n    e.stopPropogation();\n    e.preventDefault();\n  }return \n}\n```"},{"question":"What are inline conditional expressions?","answer":"You can use either if statements or ternary expressions which are available from JS to conditionally render expressions. Apart from these approaches, you can also embed any expressions in JSX by wrapping them in curly braces and then followed by JS logical operator &&.jsx harmony\n<h1>Hello!<\/h1>;\n{\n  messages.length > 0 && !isLogin ? (\n    <h2>You have {messages.length} unread messages.<\/h2>\n  ) : (\n    <h2>You don't have unread messages.<\/h2>\n  );\n}"},{"question":"What is \"key\" prop and what is the benefit of using it in arrays of elements?","answer":"A key is a special attribute you should include when creating arrays of elements. Key prop helps React identify which items have changed, are added, or are removed.Keys should be unique among its siblings. Most often we use ID from our data as key:jsx harmony\nconst todoItems = todos.map((todo) => <li key={todo.id}>{todo.text}<\/li>);When you don't have stable IDs for rendered items, you may use the item index as a key as a last resort:jsx harmony\nconst todoItems = todos.map((todo, index) => (\n  <li key={index}>{todo.text}<\/li>\n));Note:\nUsing indexes for keys is not recommended if the order of items may change. This can negatively impact performance and may cause issues with component state.\nIf you extract list item as separate component then apply keys on list component instead of li tag.\nThere will be a warning message in the console if the key prop is not present on list items.\nThe key attribute accepts either string or number and internally convert it as string type."},{"question":"What is the use of refs?","answer":"The ref is used to return a reference to the element. They should be avoided in most cases, however, they can be useful when you need a direct access to the DOM element or an instance of a component."},{"question":"How to create refs?","answer":"There are two approaches\nThis is a recently added approach. Refs are created using React.createRef() method and attached to React elements via the ref attribute. In order to use refs throughout the component, just assign the ref to the instance property within constructor.\njsx harmony\n   class MyComponent extends React.Component {\n     constructor(props) {\n       super(props);\n       this.myRef = React.createRef();\n     }\n     render() {\n       return <div ref={this.myRef} \/>;\n     }\n   }\nYou can also use ref callbacks approach regardless of React version. For example, the search bar component's input element is accessed as follows,\n   jsx harmony\n   class SearchBar extends Component {\n     constructor(props) {\n       super(props);\n       this.txtSearch = null;\n       this.state = { term: \"\" };\n       this.setInputSearchRef = (e) => {\n         this.txtSearch = e;\n       };\n     }\n     onInputChange(event) {\n       this.setState({ term: this.txtSearch.value });\n     }\n     render() {\n       return (\n         <input\n           value={this.state.term}\n           onChange={this.onInputChange.bind(this)}\n           ref={this.setInputSearchRef}\n         \/>\n       );\n     }\n   }\nYou can also use refs in function components using closures.\nNote: You can also use inline ref callbacks even though it is not a recommended approach."},{"question":"What are forward refs?","answer":"Ref forwarding is a feature that lets some components take a ref they receive, and pass it further down to a child.```jsx harmony\nconst ButtonElement = React.forwardRef((props, ref) => (\n  \n    {props.children}\n  \n));\/\/ Create ref to the DOM button:\nconst ref = React.createRef();\n{\"Forward Ref\"};\n```"},{"question":"Which is preferred option with in callback refs and findDOMNode()?","answer":"It is preferred to use callback refs over findDOMNode() API. Because findDOMNode() prevents certain improvements in React in the future.The legacy approach of using findDOMNode:```javascript\nclass MyComponent extends Component {\n  componentDidMount() {\n    findDOMNode(this).scrollIntoView();\n  }render() {\n    return ;\n  }\n}\n```The recommended approach is:```javascript\nclass MyComponent extends Component {\n  constructor(props) {\n    super(props);\n    this.node = createRef();\n  }\n  componentDidMount() {\n    this.node.current.scrollIntoView();\n  }render() {\n    return ;\n  }\n}\n```"},{"question":"Why are String Refs legacy?","answer":"If you worked with React before, you might be familiar with an older API where the ref attribute is a string, like ref={'textInput'}, and the DOM node is accessed as this.refs.textInput. We advise against it because string refs have below issues, and are considered legacy. String refs were removed in React v16.\nThey force React to keep track of currently executing component. This is problematic because it makes react module stateful, and thus causes weird errors when react module is duplicated in the bundle.\nThey are not composable \u2014 if a library puts a ref on the passed child, the user can't put another ref on it. Callback refs are perfectly composable.\nThey don't work with static analysis like Flow. Flow can't guess the magic that framework does to make the string ref appear on this.refs, as well as its type (which could be different). Callback refs are friendlier to static analysis.\nIt doesn't work as most people would expect with the \"render callback\" pattern (e.g. )\n```jsx harmony\n   class MyComponent extends Component {\n     renderRow = (index) => {\n       \/\/ This won't work. Ref will get attached to DataTable rather than MyComponent:\n       return ;   \/\/ This would work though! Callback refs are awesome.\n   return <input ref={(input) => (this[\"input-\" + index] = input)} \/>;\n };\n\n render() {\n   return (\n     <DataTable data={this.props.data} renderRow={this.renderRow} \/>\n   );\n }\n}\n   ```"},{"question":"What is Virtual DOM?","answer":"The Virtual DOM (VDOM) is an in-memory representation of Real DOM. The representation of a UI is kept in memory and synced with the \"real\" DOM. It's a step that happens between the render function being called and the displaying of elements on the screen. This entire process is called reconciliation."},{"question":"How Virtual DOM works?","answer":"The Virtual DOM works in three simple steps.\nWhenever any underlying data changes, the entire UI is re-rendered in Virtual DOM representation.\n\nThen the difference between the previous DOM representation and the new one is calculated.\n\nOnce the calculations are done, the real DOM will be updated with only the things that have actually changed."},{"question":"What is the difference between Shadow DOM and Virtual DOM?","answer":"The Shadow DOM is a browser technology designed primarily for scoping variables and CSS in web components.

Its headline feature is incremental rendering: the ability to split rendering work into chunks and spread it out over multiple frames.from documentationIts main goals are:\nAbility to split interruptible work in chunks.\nAbility to prioritize, rebase and reuse work in progress.\nAbility to yield back and forth between parents and children to support layout in React.\nAbility to return multiple elements from render().\nBetter support for error boundaries."},{"question":"What are controlled components?","answer":"A component that controls the input elements within the forms on subsequent user input is called Controlled Component, i.e, every state mutation will have an associated handler function.For example, to write all the names in uppercase letters, we use handleChange as below,javascript\nhandleChange(event) {\n  this.setState({value: event.target.value.toUpperCase()})\n}"},{"question":"What are uncontrolled components?","answer":"The Uncontrolled Components are the ones that store their own state internally, and you query the DOM using a ref to find its current value when you need it. This is a bit more like traditional HTML.In the below UserProfile component, the name input is accessed using ref.```jsx harmony\nclass UserProfile extends React.Component {\n  constructor(props) {\n    super(props);\n    this.handleSubmit = this.handleSubmit.bind(this);\n    this.input = React.createRef();\n  }handleSubmit(event) {\n    alert(\"A name was submitted: \" + this.input.current.value);\n    event.preventDefault();\n  }render() {\n    return (\n      \n\n          {\"Name:\"}\n          \n\n\n\n    );\n  }\n}\n```In most cases, it's recommend to use controlled components to implement forms. In a controlled component, form data is handled by a React component. The alternative is uncontrolled components, where form data is handled by the DOM itself."},{"question":"What is the difference between createElement and cloneElement?","answer":"JSX elements will be transpiled to React.createElement() functions to create React elements which are going to be used for the object representation of UI. Whereas cloneElement is used to clone an element and pass it new props."},{"question":"What is Lifting State Up in React?","answer":"When several components need to share the same changing data then it is recommended to lift the shared state up to their closest common ancestor. That means if two child components share the same data from its parent, then move the state to parent instead of maintaining local state in both of the child components."},{"question":"What are the different phases of component lifecycle?","answer":"The component lifecycle has three distinct lifecycle phases:\n\nMounting: The component is ready to mount in the browser DOM. This phase covers initialization from constructor(), getDerivedStateFromProps(), render(), and componentDidMount() lifecycle methods.\n\n\nUpdating: In this phase, the component gets updated in two ways, sending the new props and updating the state either from setState() or forceUpdate(). This phase covers getDerivedStateFromProps(), shouldComponentUpdate(), render(), getSnapshotBeforeUpdate() and componentDidUpdate() lifecycle methods.\n\n\nUnmounting: In this last phase, the component is not needed and gets unmounted from the browser DOM. This phase includes componentWillUnmount() lifecycle method.\n\nIt's worth mentioning that React internally has a concept of phases when applying changes to the DOM. They are separated as follows\n\nRender The component will render without any side effects. This applies to Pure components and in this phase, React can pause, abort, or restart the render.\n\n\nPre-commit Before the component actually applies the changes to the DOM, there is a moment that allows React to read from the DOM through the getSnapshotBeforeUpdate().\n\n\nCommit React works with the DOM and executes the final lifecycles respectively componentDidMount() for mounting, componentDidUpdate() for updating, and componentWillUnmount() for unmounting.\n\nReact 16.3+ Phases (or an interactive version)Before React 16.3"},{"question":"What are the lifecycle methods of React?","answer":"Before React 16.3\ncomponentWillMount: Executed before rendering and is used for App level configuration in your root component.\ncomponentDidMount: Executed after first rendering and here all AJAX requests, DOM or state updates, and set up event listeners should occur.\ncomponentWillReceiveProps: Executed when particular prop updates to trigger state transitions.\nshouldComponentUpdate: Determines if the component will be updated or not. By default it returns true. If you are sure that the component doesn't need to render after state or props are updated, you can return false value. It is a great place to improve performance as it allows you to prevent a re-render if component receives new prop.\ncomponentWillUpdate: Executed before re-rendering the component when there are props & state changes confirmed by shouldComponentUpdate() which returns true.\ncomponentDidUpdate: Mostly it is used to update the DOM in response to prop or state changes.\ncomponentWillUnmount: It will be used to cancel any outgoing network requests, or remove all event listeners associated with the component.\nReact 16.3+\ngetDerivedStateFromProps: Invoked right before calling render() and is invoked on every render. This exists for rare use cases where you need a derived state. Worth reading if you need derived state.\ncomponentDidMount: Executed after first rendering and where all AJAX requests, DOM or state updates, and set up event listeners should occur.\nshouldComponentUpdate: Determines if the component will be updated or not. By default, it returns true. If you are sure that the component doesn't need to render after the state or props are updated, you can return a false value. It is a great place to improve performance as it allows you to prevent a re-render if component receives a new prop.\ngetSnapshotBeforeUpdate: Executed right before rendered output is committed to the DOM. Any value returned by this will be passed into componentDidUpdate(). This is useful to capture information from the DOM i.e. scroll position.\ncomponentDidUpdate: Mostly it is used to update the DOM in response to prop or state changes. This will not fire if shouldComponentUpdate() returns false.\ncomponentWillUnmount It will be used to cancel any outgoing network requests, or remove all event listeners associated with the component."},{"question":"What are Higher-Order Components?","answer":"A higher-order component (HOC) is a function that takes a component and returns a new component. Basically, it's a pattern that is derived from React's compositional nature.We call them pure components because they can accept any dynamically provided child component but they won't modify or copy any behavior from their input components.javascript\nconst EnhancedComponent = higherOrderComponent(WrappedComponent);HOC can be used for many use cases:\nCode reuse, logic and bootstrap abstraction.\nRender hijacking.\nState abstraction and manipulation.\nProps manipulation."},{"question":"How to create props proxy for HOC component?","answer":"You can add\/edit props passed to the component using props proxy pattern like this:```jsx harmony\nfunction HOC(WrappedComponent) {\n  return class Test extends Component {\n    render() {\n      const newProps = {\n        title: \"New Header\",\n        footer: false,\n        showFeatureX: false,\n        showFeatureY: true,\n      };  return <WrappedComponent {...this.props} {...newProps} \/>;\n}\n};\n}\n```"},{"question":"What is context?","answer":"Context provides a way to pass data through the component tree without having to pass props down manually at every level.For example, authenticated users, locale preferences, UI themes need to be accessed in the application by many components.javascript\nconst { Provider, Consumer } = React.createContext(defaultValue);"},{"question":"What is children prop?","answer":"Children is a prop (this.props.children) that allows you to pass components as data to other components, just like any other prop you use. Component tree put between component's opening and closing tag will be passed to that component as children prop.There are several methods available in the React API to work with this prop. These include React.Children.map, React.Children.forEach, React.Children.count, React.Children.only, React.Children.toArray.A simple usage of children prop looks as below,```jsx harmony\nconst MyDiv = React.createClass({\n  render: function () {\n    return {this.props.children};\n  },\n});ReactDOM.render(\n  \n{\"Hello\"}\n{\"World\"}\n,\n  node\n);\n```"},{"question":"How to write comments in React?","answer":"The comments in React\/JSX are similar to JavaScript Multiline comments but are wrapped in curly braces.Single-line comments:jsx harmony\n<div>\n  {\/* Single-line comments(In vanilla JavaScript, the single-line comments are represented by double slash(\/\/)) *\/}\n  {`Welcome ${user}, let's play React`}\n<\/div>Multi-line comments:jsx harmony\n<div>\n  {\/* Multi-line comments for more than\n   one line *\/}\n  {`Welcome ${user}, let's play React`}\n<\/div>"},{"question":"What is the purpose of using super constructor with props argument?","answer":"A child class constructor cannot make use of this reference until the super() method has been called. The same applies to ES6 sub-classes as well. The main reason for passing props parameter to super() call is to access this.props in your child constructors.Passing props:```javascript\nclass MyComponent extends React.Component {\n  constructor(props) {\n    super(props);console.log(this.props); \/\/ prints { name: 'John', age: 42 }\n}\n}\n```Not passing props:```javascript\nclass MyComponent extends React.Component {\n  constructor(props) {\n    super();console.log(this.props); \/\/ prints undefined\n\n\/\/ but props parameter is still available\nconsole.log(props); \/\/ prints { name: 'John', age: 42 }\n}render() {\n    \/\/ no difference outside constructor\n    console.log(this.props); \/\/ prints { name: 'John', age: 42 }\n  }\n}\n```The above code snippets reveals that this.props is different only within the constructor. It would be the same outside the constructor."},{"question":"What is reconciliation?","answer":"Reconciliation is the process through which React updates the Browser DOM and makes React work faster. React use a diffing algorithm so that component updates are predictable and faster. React would first calculate the difference between the real DOM and the copy of DOM (Virtual DOM) when there's an update of components.\nReact stores a copy of Browser DOM which is called Virtual DOM. When we make changes or add data, React creates a new Virtual DOM and compares it with the previous one. This comparison is done by Diffing Algorithm.\nNow React compares the Virtual DOM with Real DOM. It finds out the changed nodes and updates only the changed nodes in Real DOM leaving the rest nodes as it is. This process is called Reconciliation."},{"question":"How to set state with a dynamic key name?","answer":"If you are using ES6 or the Babel transpiler to transform your JSX code then you can accomplish this with computed property names.javascript\nhandleInputChange(event) {\n  this.setState({ [event.target.id]: event.target.value })\n}"},{"question":"What would be the common mistake of function being called every time the component renders?","answer":"You need to make sure that function is not being called while passing the function as a parameter.jsx harmony\nrender() {\n  \/\/ Wrong: handleClick is called instead of passed as a reference!\n  return <button onClick={this.handleClick()}>{'Click Me'}<\/button>\n}Instead, pass the function itself without parenthesis:jsx harmony\nrender() {\n  \/\/ Correct: handleClick is passed as a reference!\n  return <button onClick={this.handleClick}>{'Click Me'}<\/button>\n}"},{"question":"Is lazy function supports named exports?","answer":"No, currently React.lazy function supports default exports only. If you would like to import modules which are named exports, you can create an intermediate module that reexports it as the default. It also ensures that tree shaking keeps working and don\u2019t pull unused components.\nLet's take a component file which exports multiple named components,javascript\n\/\/ MoreComponents.js\nexport const SomeComponent = \/* ... *\/;\nexport const UnusedComponent = \/* ... *\/;and reexport MoreComponents.js components in an intermediate file IntermediateComponent.jsjavascript\n\/\/ IntermediateComponent.js\nexport { SomeComponent as default } from \".\/MoreComponents.js\";Now you can import the module using lazy function as below,javascript\nimport React, { lazy } from \"react\";\nconst SomeComponent = lazy(() => import(\".\/IntermediateComponent.js\"));"},{"question":"Why React uses className over class attribute?","answer":"The attribute class is a keyword in JavaScript, and JSX is an extension of JavaScript. That's the principal reason why React uses className instead of class. Pass a string as the className prop.jsx harmony\nrender() {\n  return <span className={'menu navigation-menu'}>{'Menu'}<\/span>\n}"},{"question":"What are fragments?","answer":"It's a common pattern or practice in React for a component to return multiple elements. Fragments let you group a list of children without adding extra nodes to the DOM.\nYou need to use either  or a shorter syntax having empty tag (<>).Below is the example of how to use fragment inside Story component.\njsx harmony\nfunction Story({title, description, date}) {\n  return (\n      <Fragment>\n        <h2>{title}<\/h2>\n        <p>{description}<\/p>\n        <p>{date}<\/p>\n      <\/Fragment>\n    );\n}It is also possible to render list of fragments inside a loop with the mandatory key attribute supplied.jsx harmony\nfunction StoryBook() {\n  return stories.map(story =>\n    <Fragment key={ story.id}>\n      <h2>{story.title}<\/h2>\n      <p>{story.description}<\/p>\n      <p>{story.date}<\/p>\n    <\/Fragment>\n    );\n}Ususally you don't need to use  until unless there is a need of key attribute. The usage of shorter syntax looks like below.jsx harmony\nfunction Story({title, description, date}) {\n  return (\n      <>\n        <h2>{title}<\/h2>\n        <p>{description}<\/p>\n        <p>{date}<\/p>\n      \n    );\n}"},{"question":"Why fragments are better than container divs?","answer":"Below are the list of reasons to prefer fragments over container DOM elements,\nFragments are a bit faster and use less memory by not creating an extra DOM node. This only has a real benefit on very large and deep trees.\nSome CSS mechanisms like Flexbox and CSS Grid have a special parent-child relationships, and adding divs in the middle makes it hard to keep the desired layout.\nThe DOM Inspector is less cluttered."},{"question":"What are portals in React?","answer":"Portal is a recommended way to render children into a DOM node that exists outside the DOM hierarchy of the parent component.javascript\nReactDOM.createPortal(child, container);The first argument is any render-able React child, such as an element, string, or fragment. The second argument is a DOM element."},{"question":"What are stateless components?","answer":"If the behaviour of a component is independent of its state then it can be a stateless component. You can use either a function or a class for creating stateless components. But unless you need to use a lifecycle hook in your components, you should go for function components. There are a lot of benefits if you decide to use function components here; they are easy to write, understand, and test, a little faster, and you can avoid the this keyword altogether."},{"question":"What are stateful components?","answer":"If the behaviour of a component is dependent on the state of the component then it can be termed as stateful component. These stateful components are either function components with hooks or class components.Let's take an example of function stateful component which update the state based on click event,\n```javascript\nimport React, {useState} from 'react';const App = (props) => {\nconst [count, setCount] = useState(0);\nhandleIncrement() {\n  setCount(count+1);\n}return (\n  <>\n    Increment\nCounter: {count}\n\n  )\n}\n```See Class\n\nThe equivalent class stateful component with a state that gets initialized in the constructor.\n```jsx harmony\nclass App extends Component {\n  constructor(props) {\n    super(props);\n    this.state = { count: 0 };\n  }\nhandleIncrement() {\n    setState({count: this.state.count + 1})\n  }\nrender() {\n    <>\n      this.handleIncrement}>Increment\nCount: {count}\n\n  }\n}\n```"},{"question":"How to apply validation on props in React?","answer":"When the application is running in development mode, React will automatically check all props that we set on components to make sure they have correct type. If the type is incorrect, React will generate warning messages in the console. It's disabled in production mode due to performance impact.

This object is mainly used for server-side rendering (SSR). The following methods can be used in both the server and browser environments:\nrenderToString()\nrenderToStaticMarkup()\nFor example, you generally run a Node-based web server like Express, Hapi, or Koa, and you call renderToString to render your root component to a string, which you then send as response.```javascript\n\/\/ using Express\nimport { renderToString } from \"react-dom\/server\";\nimport MyPage from \".\/MyPage\";app.get(\"\/\", (req, res) => {\n  res.write(\n    \"<!DOCTYPE html>My Page\"\n  );\n  res.write('');\n  res.write(renderToString());\n  res.write(\"\");\n  res.end();\n});\n```"},{"question":"How to use innerHTML in React?","answer":"The dangerouslySetInnerHTML attribute is React's replacement for using innerHTML in the browser DOM. Just like innerHTML, it is risky to use this attribute considering cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. You just need to pass a __html object as key and HTML text as value.In this example MyComponent uses dangerouslySetInnerHTML attribute for setting HTML markup:```jsx harmony\nfunction createMarkup() {\n  return { __html: \"First \u00b7 Second\" };\n}function MyComponent() {\n  return ;\n}\n```"},{"question":"How to use styles in React?","answer":"The style attribute accepts a JavaScript object with camelCased properties rather than a CSS string. This is consistent with the DOM style JavaScript property, is more efficient, and prevents XSS security holes.```jsx harmony\nconst divStyle = {\n  color: \"blue\",\n  backgroundImage: \"url(\" + imgUrl + \")\",\n};function HelloWorldComponent() {\n  return Hello World!;\n}\n```Style keys are camelCased in order to be consistent with accessing the properties on DOM nodes in JavaScript (e.g. node.style.backgroundImage)."},{"question":"How events are different in React?","answer":"Handling events in React elements has some syntactic differences:\nReact event handlers are named using camelCase, rather than lowercase.\nWith JSX you pass a function as the event handler, rather than a string."},{"question":"What will happen if you use setState() in constructor?","answer":"When you use setState(), then apart from assigning to the object state React also re-renders the component and all its children. You would get error like this: Can only update a mounted or mounting component. So we need to use this.state to initialize variables inside constructor."},{"question":"What is the impact of indexes as keys?","answer":"Keys should be stable, predictable, and unique so that React can keep track of elements.In the below code snippet each element's key will be based on ordering, rather than tied to the data that is being represented. This limits the optimizations that React can do.jsx harmony\n{\n  todos.map((todo, index) => <Todo {...todo} key={index} \/>);\n}If you use element data for unique key, assuming todo.id is unique to this list and stable, React would be able to reorder elements without needing to reevaluate them as much.jsx harmony\n{\n  todos.map((todo) => <Todo {...todo} key={todo.id} \/>);\n}"},{"question":"Is it good to use setState() in componentWillMount() method?","answer":"Yes, it is safe to use setState() inside componentWillMount() method. But at the same it is recommended to avoid async initialization in componentWillMount() lifecycle method. componentWillMount() is invoked immediately before mounting occurs. It is called before render(), therefore setting state in this method will not trigger a re-render. Avoid introducing any side-effects or subscriptions in this method. We need to make sure async calls for component initialization happened in componentDidMount() instead of componentWillMount().jsx harmony\ncomponentDidMount() {\n  axios.get(`api\/todos`)\n    .then((result) => {\n      this.setState({\n        messages: [...result.data]\n      })\n    })\n}"},{"question":"What will happen if you use props in initial state?","answer":"If the props on the component are changed without the component being refreshed, the new prop value will never be displayed because the constructor function will never update the current state of the component. The initialization of state from props only runs when the component is first created.The below component won't display the updated input value:```jsx harmony\nclass MyComponent extends React.Component {\n  constructor(props) {\n    super(props);this.state = {\n  records: [],\n  inputValue: this.props.inputValue,\n};\n}render() {\n    return {this.state.inputValue};\n  }\n}\n```Using props inside render method will update the value:```jsx harmony\nclass MyComponent extends React.Component {\n  constructor(props) {\n    super(props);this.state = {\n  record: [],\n};\n}render() {\n    return {this.props.inputValue};\n  }\n}\n```"},{"question":"How do you conditionally render components?","answer":"In some cases you want to render different components depending on some state. JSX does not render false or undefined, so you can use conditional short-circuiting to render a given part of your component only if a certain condition is true.jsx harmony\nconst MyComponent = ({ name, address }) => (\n  <div>\n    <h2>{name}<\/h2>\n    {address && <p>{address}<\/p>}\n  <\/div>\n);If you need an if-else condition then use ternary operator.jsx harmony\nconst MyComponent = ({ name, address }) => (\n  <div>\n    <h2>{name}<\/h2>\n    {address ? <p>{address}<\/p> : <p>{\"Address is not available\"}<\/p>}\n  <\/div>\n);"},{"question":"Why we need to be careful when spreading props on DOM elements?","answer":"When we spread props we run into the risk of adding unknown HTML attributes, which is a bad practice. Instead we can use prop destructuring with ...rest operator, so it will add only required props.For example,```jsx harmony\nconst ComponentA = () => (\n  \n);const ComponentB = ({ isDisplay, ...domProps }) => (\n  {\"ComponentB\"}\n);\n```"},{"question":"How you use decorators in React?","answer":"You can decorate your class components, which is the same as passing the component into a function. Decorators are flexible and readable way of modifying component functionality.```jsx harmony\n@setTitle(\"Profile\")\nclass Profile extends React.Component {\n  \/\/....\n}\/\n  title is a string that will be set as a document title\n  WrappedComponent is what our decorator will receive when\n  put directly above a component class as seen in the example above\n\/\nconst setTitle = (title) => (WrappedComponent) => {\n  return class extends React.Component {\n    componentDidMount() {\n      document.title = title;\n    }render() {\n  return <WrappedComponent {...this.props} \/>;\n}\n};\n};\n```Note: Decorators are a feature that didn't make it into ES7, but are currently a stage 2 proposal."},{"question":"How do you memoize a component?","answer":"There are memoize libraries available which can be used on function components.For example moize library can memoize the component in another component.```jsx harmony\nimport moize from \"moize\";\nimport Component from \".\/components\/Component\"; \/\/ this module exports a non-memoized componentconst MemoizedFoo = moize.react(Component);const Consumer = () => {\n  \n    {\"I will memoize the following entry:\"}\n    \n;\n};\n```Update: Since React v16.6.0, we have a React.memo. It provides a higher order component which memoizes component unless the props change.

We need to use object to map prop values to components.For example, a switching component to display different pages based on page prop:```jsx harmony\nimport HomePage from \".\/HomePage\";\nimport AboutPage from \".\/AboutPage\";\nimport ServicesPage from \".\/ServicesPage\";\nimport ContactPage from \".\/ContactPage\";const PAGES = {\n  home: HomePage,\n  about: AboutPage,\n  services: ServicesPage,\n  contact: ContactPage,\n};const Page = (props) => {\n  const Handler = PAGES[props.page] || ContactPage;return ;\n};\/\/ The keys of the PAGES object can be used in the prop types to catch dev-time errors.\nPage.propTypes = {\n  page: PropTypes.oneOf(Object.keys(PAGES)).isRequired,\n};\n```"},{"question":"Why we need to pass a function to setState()?","answer":"The reason behind for this is that setState() is an asynchronous operation. React batches state changes for performance reasons, so the state may not change immediately after setState() is called. That means you should not rely on the current state when calling setState()\u200asince you can't be sure what that state will be. The solution is to pass a function to setState(), with the previous state as an argument. By doing this you can avoid issues with the user getting the old state value on access due to the asynchronous nature of setState().Let's say the initial count value is zero. After three consecutive increment operations, the value is going to be incremented only by one.javascript\n\/\/ assuming this.state.count === 0\nthis.setState({ count: this.state.count + 1 });\nthis.setState({ count: this.state.count + 1 });\nthis.setState({ count: this.state.count + 1 });\n\/\/ this.state.count === 1, not 3If we pass a function to setState(), the count gets incremented correctly.javascript\nthis.setState((prevState, props) => ({\n  count: prevState.count + props.increment,\n}));\n\/\/ this.state.count === 3 as expected(OR)"},{"question":"Why function is preferred over object for setState()?","answer":"React may batch multiple setState() calls into a single update for performance. Because this.props and this.state may be updated asynchronously, you should not rely on their values for calculating the next state.This counter example will fail to update as expected:javascript\n\/\/ Wrong\nthis.setState({\n  counter: this.state.counter + this.props.increment,\n});The preferred approach is to call setState() with function rather than object. That function will receive the previous state as the first argument, and the props at the time the update is applied as the second argument.javascript\n\/\/ Correct\nthis.setState((prevState, props) => ({\n  counter: prevState.counter + props.increment,\n}));"},{"question":"What is strict mode in React?","answer":"React.StrictMode is a useful component for highlighting potential problems in an application. Just like <Fragment>, <StrictMode> does not render any extra DOM elements. It activates additional checks and warnings for its descendants. These checks apply for development mode only.```jsx harmony\nimport React from \"react\";function ExampleApplication() {\n  return (\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  );\n}\n```In the example above, the strict mode checks apply to <ComponentOne> and <ComponentTwo> components only.React.StrictMode currently helps you with:\nIdentifying components with unsafe lifecycles\nWarning about legacy string ref API usage\nWarning about deprecated findDOMNode usage\nDetecting unexpected side effects\nDetecting legacy context API"},{"question":"What are React Mixins?","answer":"Mixins are a way to totally separate components to have a common functionality. Mixins should not be used and can be replaced with higher-order components or decorators.One of the most commonly used mixins is PureRenderMixin. You might be using it in some components to prevent unnecessary re-renders when the props and state are shallowly equal to the previous props and state:```javascript\nconst PureRenderMixin = require(\"react-addons-pure-render-mixin\");const Button = React.createClass({\n  mixins: [PureRenderMixin],\n  \/\/ ...\n});\n```"},{"question":"Why is isMounted() an anti-pattern and what is the proper solution?","answer":"The primary use case for isMounted() is to avoid calling setState() after a component has been unmounted, because it will emit a warning.javascript\nif (this.isMounted()) {\n  this.setState({...})\n}Checking isMounted() before calling setState() does eliminate the warning, but it also defeats the purpose of the warning. Using isMounted() is a code smell because the only reason you would check is because you think you might be holding a reference after the component has unmounted.An optimal solution would be to find places where setState() might be called after a component has unmounted, and fix them. Such situations most commonly occur due to callbacks, when a component is waiting for some data and gets unmounted before the data arrives. Ideally, any callbacks should be canceled in componentWillUnmount(), prior to unmounting."},{"question":"What are the Pointer Events supported in React?","answer":"Pointer Events provide a unified way of handling all input events. In the old days we had a mouse and respective event listeners to handle them but nowadays we have many devices which don't correlate to having a mouse, like phones with touch surface or pens. We need to remember that these events will only work in browsers that support the Pointer Events specification.The following event types are now available in React DOM:\nonPointerDown\nonPointerMove\nonPointerUp\nonPointerCancel\nonGotPointerCapture\nonLostPointerCapture\nonPointerEnter\nonPointerLeave\nonPointerOver\nonPointerOut"},{"question":"Why should component names start with capital letter?","answer":"If you are rendering your component using JSX, the name of that component has to begin with a capital letter otherwise React will throw an error as an unrecognized tag. This convention is because only HTML elements and SVG tags can begin with a lowercase letter.jsx harmony\nclass SomeComponent extends Component {\n  \/\/ Code goes here\n}You can define component class which name starts with lowercase letter, but when it's imported it should have capital letter. Here lowercase is fine:```jsx harmony\nclass myComponent extends Component {\n  render() {\n    return ;\n  }\n}export default myComponent;\n```While when imported in another file it should start with capital letter:jsx harmony\nimport MyComponent from \".\/myComponent\";What are the exceptions on React component naming?The component names should start with an uppercase letter but there are few exceptions to this convention. The lowercase tag names with a dot (property accessors) are still considered as valid component names.\nFor example, the below tag can be compiled to a valid component,jsx harmony\n     render() {\n          return (\n            <obj.component\/> \/\/ `React.createElement(obj.component)`\n          )\n    }"},{"question":"Are custom DOM attributes supported in React v16?","answer":"Yes. In the past, React used to ignore unknown DOM attributes. If you wrote JSX with an attribute that React doesn't recognize, React would just skip it.For example, let's take a look at the below attribute:jsx harmony\n<div mycustomattribute={\"something\"} \/>Would render an empty div to the DOM with React v15:html\n<div \/>In React v16 any unknown attributes will end up in the DOM:html\n<div mycustomattribute=\"something\" \/>This is useful for supplying browser-specific non-standard attributes, trying new DOM APIs, and integrating with opinionated third-party libraries."},{"question":"What is the difference between constructor and getInitialState?","answer":"You should initialize state in the constructor when using ES6 classes, and getInitialState() method when using React.createClass().Using ES6 classes:javascript\nclass MyComponent extends React.Component {\n  constructor(props) {\n    super(props);\n    this.state = {\n      \/* initial state *\/\n    };\n  }\n}Using React.createClass():javascript\nconst MyComponent = React.createClass({\n  getInitialState() {\n    return {\n      \/* initial state *\/\n    };\n  },\n});Note: React.createClass() is deprecated and removed in React v16. Use plain JavaScript classes instead."},{"question":"Can you force a component to re-render without calling setState?","answer":"By default, when your component's state or props change, your component will re-render. If your render() method depends on some other data, you can tell React that the component needs re-rendering by calling forceUpdate().javascript\ncomponent.forceUpdate(callback);It is recommended to avoid all uses of forceUpdate() and only read from this.props and this.state in render()."},{"question":"What is the difference between super() and super(props) in React using ES6 classes?","answer":"When you want to access this.props in constructor() then you should pass props to super() method.Using super(props):javascript\nclass MyComponent extends React.Component {\n  constructor(props) {\n    super(props);\n    console.log(this.props); \/\/ { name: 'John', ... }\n  }\n}Using super():javascript\nclass MyComponent extends React.Component {\n  constructor(props) {\n    super();\n    console.log(this.props); \/\/ undefined\n  }\n}Outside constructor() both will display same value for this.props."},{"question":"How to loop inside JSX?","answer":"You can simply use Array.prototype.map with ES6 arrow function syntax.For example, the items array of objects is mapped into an array of components:jsx harmony\n<tbody>\n  {items.map((item) => (\n    <SomeComponent key={item.id} name={item.name} \/>\n  ))}\n<\/tbody>But you can't iterate using for loop:jsx harmony\n<tbody>\n  for (let i = 0; i < items.length; i++) {\n    <SomeComponent key={items[i].id} name={items[i].name} \/>\n  }\n<\/tbody>This is because JSX tags are transpiled into function calls, and you can't use statements inside expressions.

Redux can be used together with React, or with any other view library. It is tiny (about 2kB) and has no dependencies."},{"question":"What are the core principles of Redux?","answer":"Redux follows three fundamental principles:\nSingle source of truth: The state of your whole application is stored in an object tree within a single store. The single state tree makes it easier to keep track of changes over time and debug or inspect the application.\nState is read-only: The only way to change the state is to emit an action, an object describing what happened. This ensures that neither the views nor the network callbacks will ever write directly to the state.\nChanges are made with pure functions: To specify how the state tree is transformed by actions, you write reducers. Reducers are just pure functions that take the previous state and an action as parameters, and return the next state."},{"question":"What are the downsides of Redux compared to Flux?","answer":"Instead of saying downsides we can say that there are few compromises of using Redux over Flux. Those are as follows:\nYou will need to learn to avoid mutations: Flux is un-opinionated about mutating data, but Redux doesn't like mutations and many packages complementary to Redux assume you never mutate the state. You can enforce this with dev-only packages like redux-immutable-state-invariant, Immutable.js, or instructing your team to write non-mutating code.\nYou're going to have to carefully pick your packages: While Flux explicitly doesn't try to solve problems such as undo\/redo, persistence, or forms, Redux has extension points such as middleware and store enhancers, and it has spawned a rich ecosystem.\nThere is no nice Flow integration yet: Flux currently lets you do very impressive static type checks which Redux doesn't support yet."},{"question":"What is the difference between mapStateToProps() and mapDispatchToProps()?","answer":"mapStateToProps() is a utility which helps your component get updated state (which is updated by some other components):javascript\n const mapStateToProps = (state) => {\n   return {\n     todos: getVisibleTodos(state.todos, state.visibilityFilter),\n   };\n };mapDispatchToProps() is a utility which will help your component to fire an action event (dispatching action which may cause change of application state):javascript\n const mapDispatchToProps = (dispatch) => {\n   return {\n     onTodoClick: (id) => {\n       dispatch(toggleTodo(id));\n     },\n   };\n };It is recommended to always use the \u201cobject shorthand\u201d form for the mapDispatchToProps.Redux wraps it in another function that looks like (\u2026args) => dispatch(onTodoClick(\u2026args)), and pass that wrapper function as a prop to your component.javascript\n const mapDispatchToProps = {\n   onTodoClick,\n };"},{"question":"Can I dispatch an action in reducer?","answer":"Dispatching an action within a reducer is an anti-pattern. Your reducer should be without side effects, simply digesting the action payload and returning a new state object. Adding listeners and dispatching actions within the reducer can lead to chained actions and other side effects."},{"question":"How to access Redux store outside a component?","answer":"You just need to export the store from the module where it created with createStore().

It is usually used as an architecture for UIs. Think of it as an alternative to (half of) Angular. RxJS is a reactive programming library. It is usually used as a tool to accomplish asynchronous tasks in JavaScript. Think of it as an alternative to Promises. Redux uses the Reactive paradigm because the Store is reactive. The Store observes actions from a distance, and changes itself.

Also, React Redux uses context internally but it doesn't expose this fact in the public API."},{"question":"Why are Redux state functions called reducers?","answer":"Reducers always return the accumulation of the state (based on all previous and current actions). Therefore, they act as a reducer of state. Each time a Redux reducer is called, the state and action are passed as parameters. This state is then reduced (or accumulated) based on the action, and then the next state is returned. You could reduce a collection of actions and an initial state (of the store) on which to perform these actions to get the resulting final state."},{"question":"How to make AJAX request in Redux?","answer":"You can use redux-thunk middleware which allows you to define async actions.Let's take an example of fetching specific account as an AJAX call using fetch API:``javascript\n export function fetchAccount(id) {\n   return (dispatch) => {\n     dispatch(setLoadingAccountState()); \/\/ Show a loading spinner\n     fetch(\/account\/${id}`, (response) => {\n       dispatch(doneFetchingAccount()); \/\/ Hide loading spinner\n       if (response.status === 200) {\n         dispatch(setAccount(response.json)); \/\/ Use a normal function to set the received state\n       } else {\n         dispatch(someError);\n       }\n     });\n   };\n }function setAccount(data) {\n   return { type: \"SET_Account\", data: data };\n }\n ```"},{"question":"Should I keep all component's state in Redux store?","answer":"Keep your data in the Redux store, and the UI related state internally in the component."},{"question":"What is the proper way to access Redux store?","answer":"The best way to access your store in a component is to use the connect() function, that creates a new component that wraps around your existing one. This pattern is called Higher-Order Components, and is generally the preferred way of extending a component's functionality in React. This allows you to map state and action creators to your component, and have them passed in automatically as your store updates.Let's take an example of <FilterLink> component using connect:```javascript\n import { connect } from \"react-redux\";\n import { setVisibilityFilter } from \"..\/actions\";\n import Link from \"..\/components\/Link\";const mapStateToProps = (state, ownProps) => ({\n   active: ownProps.filter === state.visibilityFilter,\n });const mapDispatchToProps = (dispatch, ownProps) => ({\n   onClick: () => dispatch(setVisibilityFilter(ownProps.filter)),\n });const FilterLink = connect(mapStateToProps, mapDispatchToProps)(Link);export default FilterLink;\n ```Due to it having quite a few performance optimizations and generally being less likely to cause bugs, the Redux developers almost always recommend using connect() over accessing the store directly (using context API).javascript\n class MyComponent {\n   someMethod() {\n     doSomethingWith(this.context.store);\n   }\n }"},{"question":"What is the difference between component and container in React Redux?","answer":"Component is a class or function component that describes the presentational part of your application.Container is an informal term for a component that is connected to a Redux store. Containers subscribe to Redux state updates and dispatch actions, and they usually don't render DOM elements; they delegate rendering to presentational child components."},{"question":"What is the purpose of the constants in Redux?","answer":"Constants allows you to easily find all usages of that specific functionality across the project when you use an IDE. It also prevents you from introducing silly bugs caused by typos \u2013 in which case, you will get a ReferenceError immediately.Normally we will save them in a single file (constants.js or actionTypes.js).javascript\n export const ADD_TODO = \"ADD_TODO\";\n export const DELETE_TODO = \"DELETE_TODO\";\n export const EDIT_TODO = \"EDIT_TODO\";\n export const COMPLETE_TODO = \"COMPLETE_TODO\";\n export const COMPLETE_ALL = \"COMPLETE_ALL\";\n export const CLEAR_COMPLETED = \"CLEAR_COMPLETED\";In Redux, you use them in two places:\n\nDuring action creation:\nLet's take actions.js:\n```javascript\nimport { ADD_TODO } from \".\/actionTypes\";\nexport function addTodo(text) {\n  return { type: ADD_TODO, text };\n}\n```\n\n\nIn reducers:\nLet's create reducer.js:\n```javascript\nimport { ADD_TODO } from \".\/actionTypes\";\nexport default (state = [], action) => {\n  switch (action.type) {\n    case ADD_TODO:\n      return [\n        ...state,\n        {\n          text: action.text,\n          completed: false,\n        },\n      ];\n    default:\n      return state;\n  }\n};\n```"},{"question":"What are the different ways to write mapDispatchToProps()?","answer":"There are a few ways of binding action creators to dispatch() in mapDispatchToProps().Below are the possible options:javascript\n const mapDispatchToProps = (dispatch) => ({\n   action: () => dispatch(action()),\n });javascript\n const mapDispatchToProps = (dispatch) => ({\n   action: bindActionCreators(action, dispatch),\n });javascript\n const mapDispatchToProps = { action };The third option is just a shorthand for the first one."},{"question":"What is the use of the ownProps parameter in mapStateToProps() and mapDispatchToProps()?","answer":"If the ownProps parameter is specified, React Redux will pass the props that were passed to the component into your connect functions. So, if you use a connected component:```jsx harmony\n import ConnectedComponent from \".\/containers\/ConnectedComponent\";;\n ```The ownProps inside your mapStateToProps() and mapDispatchToProps() functions will be an object:javascript\n {\n   user: \"john\";\n }You can use this object to decide what to return from those functions."},{"question":"How to structure Redux top level directories?","answer":"Most of the applications has several top-level directories as below:\nComponents: Used for dumb components unaware of Redux.\nContainers: Used for smart components connected to Redux.\nActions: Used for all action creators, where file names correspond to part of the app.\nReducers: Used for all reducers, where files name correspond to state key.\nStore: Used for store initialization.\nThis structure works well for small and medium size apps."},{"question":"What is redux-saga?","answer":"redux-saga is a library that aims to make side effects (asynchronous things like data fetching and impure things like accessing the browser cache) in React\/Redux applications easier and better.It is available in NPM:console\n $ npm install --save redux-saga"},{"question":"What is the mental model of redux-saga?","answer":"Saga is like a separate thread in your application, that's solely responsible for side effects. redux-saga is a redux middleware, which means this thread can be started, paused and cancelled from the main application with normal Redux actions, it has access to the full Redux application state and it can dispatch Redux actions as well."},{"question":"What are the differences between call() and put() in redux-saga?","answer":"Both call() and put() are effect creator functions. call() function is used to create effect description, which instructs middleware to call the promise. put() function creates an effect, which instructs middleware to dispatch an action to the store.Let's take example of how these effects work for fetching particular user data.``javascript\n function* fetchUserSaga(action) {\n   \/\/callfunction accepts rest arguments, which will be passed toapi.fetchUserfunction.\n   \/\/ Instructing middleware to call promise, it resolved value will be assigned touserData` variable\n   const userData = yield call(api.fetchUser, action.userId);\/\/ Instructing middleware to dispatch corresponding action.\n   yield put({\n     type: \"FETCH_USER_SUCCESS\",\n     userData,\n   });\n }\n ```"},{"question":"What is Redux Thunk?","answer":"Redux Thunk middleware allows you to write action creators that return a function instead of an action. The thunk can be used to delay the dispatch of an action, or to dispatch only if a certain condition is met. The inner function receives the store methods dispatch() and getState() as parameters."},{"question":"What are the differences between redux-saga and redux-thunk?","answer":"Both Redux Thunk and Redux Saga take care of dealing with side effects. In most of the scenarios, Thunk uses Promises to deal with them, whereas Saga uses Generators. Thunk is simple to use and Promises are familiar to many developers, Sagas\/Generators are more powerful but you will need to learn them. But both middleware can coexist, so you can start with Thunks and introduce Sagas when\/if you need them."},{"question":"What is Redux DevTools?","answer":"Redux DevTools is a live-editing time travel environment for Redux with hot reloading, action replay, and customizable UI. If you don't want to bother with installing Redux DevTools and integrating it into your project, consider using Redux DevTools Extension for Chrome and Firefox."},{"question":"What are the features of Redux DevTools?","answer":"Some of the main features of Redux DevTools are below,\nLets you inspect every state and action payload.\nLets you go back in time by cancelling actions.\nIf you change the reducer code, each staged action will be re-evaluated.\nIf the reducers throw, you will see during which action this happened, and what the error was.\nWith persistState() store enhancer, you can persist debug sessions across page reloads."},{"question":"What are Redux selectors and why to use them?","answer":"Selectors are functions that take Redux state as an argument and return some data to pass to the component.For example, to get user details from the state:javascript\n const getUserData = (state) => state.user.data;These selectors have two main benefits,\nThe selector can compute derived data, allowing Redux to store the minimal possible state\nThe selector is not recomputed unless one of its arguments changes"},{"question":"What is Redux Form?","answer":"Redux Form works with React and Redux to enable a form in React to use Redux to store all of its state. Redux Form can be used with raw HTML5 inputs, but it also works very well with common UI frameworks like Material UI, React Widgets and React Bootstrap."},{"question":"What are the main features of Redux Form?","answer":"Some of the main features of Redux Form are:\nField values persistence via Redux store.\nValidation (sync\/async) and submission.\nFormatting, parsing and normalization of field values."},{"question":"How to add multiple middlewares to Redux?","answer":"You can use applyMiddleware().For example, you can add redux-thunk and logger passing them as arguments to applyMiddleware():javascript\n import { createStore, applyMiddleware } from \"redux\";\n const createStoreWithMiddleware = applyMiddleware(\n   ReduxThunk,\n   logger\n )(createStore);"},{"question":"How to set initial state in Redux?","answer":"You need to pass initial state as second argument to createStore:```javascript\n const rootReducer = combineReducers({\n   todos: todos,\n   visibilityFilter: visibilityFilter,\n });const initialState = {\n   todos: [{ id: 123, name: \"example\", completed: false }],\n };const store = createStore(rootReducer, initialState);\n ```"},{"question":"How Relay is different from Redux?","answer":"Relay is similar to Redux in that they both use a single store. The main difference is that relay only manages state originated from the server, and all access to the state is used via GraphQL queries (for reading data) and mutations (for changing data). Relay caches the data for you and optimizes data fetching for you, by fetching only changed data and nothing more."},{"question":"What is an action in Redux?","answer":"Actions are plain JavaScript objects or payloads of information that send data from your application to your store. They are the only source of information for the store. Actions must have a type property that indicates the type of action being performed.For example, let's take an action which represents adding a new todo item:{\n   type: ADD_TODO,\n   text: 'Add todo item'\n }"},{"question":"What is the difference between React Native and React?","answer":"React is a JavaScript library, supporting both front end web and being run on the server, for building user interfaces and web applications.React Native is a mobile framework that compiles to native app components, allowing you to build native mobile applications (iOS, Android, and Windows) in JavaScript that allows you to use React to build your components, and implements React under the hood."},{"question":"How to test React Native apps?","answer":"React Native can be tested only in mobile simulators like iOS and Android.

It was originally written to compute derived data from Redux-like applications state, but it can't be tied to any architecture or library.Reselect keeps a copy of the last inputs\/outputs of the last call, and recomputes the result only if one of the inputs changes. If the the same inputs are provided twice in a row, Reselect returns the cached output. It's memoization and cache are fully customizable."},{"question":"What is Flow?","answer":"Flow is a static type checker designed to find type errors in JavaScript. Flow types can express much more fine-grained distinctions than traditional type systems. For example, Flow helps you catch errors involving null, unlike most type systems."},{"question":"What is the difference between Flow and PropTypes?","answer":"Flow is a static analysis tool (static checker) which uses a superset of the language, allowing you to add type annotations to all of your code and catch an entire class of bugs at compile time.PropTypes is a basic type checker (runtime checker) which has been patched onto React. It can't check anything other than the types of the props being passed to a given component.

If the values are the same then you need to return null to stop re-rendering otherwise return the latest state value.For example, the user profile information is conditionally rendered as follows,jsx\n getUserProfile = (user) => {\n   const latestAddress = user.address;\n   this.setState((state) => {\n     if (state.address === latestAddress) {\n       return null;\n     } else {\n       return { title: latestAddress };\n     }\n   });\n };"},{"question":"How do you render Array, Strings and Numbers in React 16 Version?","answer":"Arrays: Unlike older releases, you don't need to make sure render method return a single element in React16. You are able to return multiple sibling elements without a wrapping element by returning an array.For example, let us take the below list of developers,jsx\n const ReactJSDevs = () => {\n   return [\n     <li key=\"1\">John<\/li>,\n     <li key=\"2\">Jackie<\/li>,\n     <li key=\"3\">Jordan<\/li>,\n   ];\n };You can also merge this array of items in another array component.jsx\n const JSDevs = () => {\n   return (\n     <ul>\n       <li>Brad<\/li>\n       <li>Brodge<\/li>\n       <ReactJSDevs \/>\n       <li>Brandon<\/li>\n     <\/ul>\n   );\n };Strings and Numbers: You can also return string and number type from the render method.jsx\n render() {\n  return 'Welcome to ReactJS questions';\n }\n \/\/ Number\n render() {\n  return 2018;\n }"},{"question":"How to use class field declarations syntax in React classes?","answer":"React Class Components can be made much more concise using the class field declarations. You can initialize the local state without using the constructor and declare class methods by using arrow functions without the extra need to bind them.Let's take a counter example to demonstrate class field declarations for state without using constructor and methods without binding,```jsx\n class Counter extends Component {\n   state = { value: 0 };handleIncrement = () => {\n     this.setState((prevState) => ({\n       value: prevState.value + 1,\n     }));\n   };handleDecrement = () => {\n     this.setState((prevState) => ({\n       value: prevState.value - 1,\n     }));\n   };render() {\n     return (\n       \n         {this.state.value}     <button onClick={this.handleIncrement}>+<\/button>\n     <button onClick={this.handleDecrement}>-<\/button>\n   <\/div>\n );\n}\n }\n ```"},{"question":"What are hooks?","answer":"Hooks is a special JavaScript function that allows you use state and other React features without writing a class. This pattern has been introduced as a new feature in React 16.8 and helped to isolate the stateful logic from the components.Let's see an example of useState hook:```jsx\n import { useState } from \"react\";function Example() {\n   \/\/ Declare a new state variable, which we'll call \"count\"\n   const [count, setCount] = useState(0);return (\n     <>\n       You clicked {count} times\n setCount(count + 1)}>Click me\n\n   );\n }\n ```Note: Hooks can be used inside an existing function component without rewriting the component."},{"question":"What rules need to be followed for hooks?","answer":"You need to follow two rules in order to use hooks,\nCall Hooks only at the top level of your react functions: You shouldn\u2019t call Hooks inside loops, conditions, or nested functions. This will ensure that Hooks are called in the same order each time a component renders and it preserves the state of Hooks between multiple useState and useEffect calls.\nCall Hooks from React Functions only: You shouldn\u2019t call Hooks from regular JavaScript functions. Instead, you should call them from either function components or custom hooks.\nThe eslint plugin named eslint-plugin-react-hooks can be used to enforce these two rules."},{"question":"How to ensure hooks followed the rules in your project?","answer":"React team released an ESLint plugin called **eslint-plugin-react-hooks** that enforces these two rules. You can add this plugin to your project using the below command,\n ```javascript\n npm install eslint-plugin-react-hooks@next\n ```\n And apply the below config in your ESLint config file,\n ```javascript\n \/\/ Your ESLint configuration\n {\n   \"plugins\": [\n     \/\/ ...\n     \"react-hooks\"\n   ],\n   \"rules\": {\n     \/\/ ...\n     \"react-hooks\/rules-of-hooks\": \"error\"\n   }\n }\n ```\nFor example, the linter enforce proper naming convention for hooks. If you rename your custom hooks which as prefix \"use\" to something else then linter won't allow you to call built-in hooks such as useState, useEffect etc inside of your custom hook anymore.Note: This plugin is intended to use in Create React App by default."},{"question":"What are the differences between Flux and Redux?","answer":"Below are the major differences between Flux and Redux| Flux                                           | Redux                                      |\n | ---------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |\n | State is mutable                               | State is immutable                         |\n | The Store contains both state and change logic | The Store and change logic are separate    |\n | There are multiple stores exist                | There is only one store exist              |\n | All the stores are disconnected and flat       | Single store with hierarchical reducers    |\n | It has a singleton dispatcher                  | There is no concept of dispatcher          |\n | React components subscribe to the store        | Container components uses connect function |"},{"question":"What are the benefits of React Router V4?","answer":"Below are the main benefits of React Router V4 module,\nIn React Router v4(version 4), the API is completely about components.

Unlike the render method and lifecycle methods, the event handlers don\u2019t happen during rendering. So if they throw, React still knows what to display on the screen.If you need to catch an error inside an event handler, use the regular JavaScript try \/ catch statement:```javascript\n class MyComponent extends React.Component {\n   constructor(props) {\n     super(props);\n     this.state = { error: null };\n     this.handleClick = this.handleClick.bind(this);\n   }handleClick() {\n     try {\n       \/\/ Do something that could throw\n     } catch (error) {\n       this.setState({ error });\n     }\n   }render() {\n     if (this.state.error) {\n       return Caught an error.;\n     }\n     return Click Me;\n   }\n }\n ```Note that the above example is demonstrating regular JavaScript behavior and doesn\u2019t use error boundaries."},{"question":"What is the difference between try catch block and error boundaries?","answer":"Try catch block works with imperative code whereas error boundaries are meant for declarative code to render on the screen.For example, the try catch block used for below imperative codejavascript\n try {\n   showButton();\n } catch (error) {\n   \/\/ ...\n }Whereas error boundaries wrap declarative code as below,javascript\n <ErrorBoundary>\n   <MyComponent \/>\n <\/ErrorBoundary>So if an error occurs in a componentDidUpdate method caused by a setState somewhere deep in the tree, it will still correctly propagate to the closest error boundary."},{"question":"What is the behavior of uncaught errors in react 16?","answer":"In React 16, errors that were not caught by any error boundary will result in unmounting of the whole React component tree. The reason behind this decision is that it is worse to leave corrupted UI in place than to completely remove it. For example, it is worse for a payments app to display a wrong amount than to render nothing."},{"question":"What is the proper placement for error boundaries?","answer":"The granularity of error boundaries usage is up to the developer based on project needs.

These default props are used when props not supplied(i.e., undefined props), but not for null props. That means, If you provide null value then it remains null value.For example, let us create color default prop for the button component,```javascript\n function MyButton {\n   \/\/ ...\n }MyButton.defaultProps = {\n   color: \"red\",\n };\n ```If props.color is not provided then it will set the default value to 'red'. i.e, Whenever you try to access the color prop it uses the default valuejavascript\n render() {\n    return <MyButton \/> ; \/\/ props.color will contain red value\n  }"},{"question":"Why should not call setState in componentWillUnmount?","answer":"You should not call `setState()` in `componentWillUnmount()` because once a component instance is unmounted, it will never be mounted again."},{"question":"What is the purpose of getDerivedStateFromError?","answer":"This lifecycle method is invoked after an error has been thrown by a descendant component.

Below are the few listed in an order,\n\nDon\u2019t use HOCs inside the render method:\n    It is not recommended to apply a HOC to a component within the render method of a component.\njavascript\nrender() {\n  \/\/ A new version of EnhancedComponent is created on every render\n  \/\/ EnhancedComponent1 !== EnhancedComponent2\n  const EnhancedComponent = enhance(MyComponent);\n  \/\/ That causes the entire subtree to unmount\/remount each time!\n  return <EnhancedComponent \/>;\n}\nThe above code impacts on performance by remounting a component that causes the state of that component and all of its children to be lost. Instead, apply HOCs outside the component definition so that the resulting component is created only once.\n\n\nStatic methods must be copied over:\n    When you apply a HOC to a component the new component does not have any of the static methods of the original component\n```javascript\n\/\/ Define a static method\nWrappedComponent.staticMethod = function () {\n  \/...\/\n};\n\/\/ Now apply a HOC\nconst EnhancedComponent = enhance(WrappedComponent);\n\/\/ The enhanced component has no static method\ntypeof EnhancedComponent.staticMethod === \"undefined\"; \/\/ true\n```\nYou can overcome this by copying the methods onto the container before returning it,\njavascript\nfunction enhance(WrappedComponent) {\n  class Enhance extends React.Component {\n    \/*...*\/\n  }\n  \/\/ Must know exactly which method(s) to copy :(\n  Enhance.staticMethod = WrappedComponent.staticMethod;\n  return Enhance;\n}\n\n\nRefs aren\u2019t passed through:\n    For HOCs you need to pass through all props to the wrapped component but this does not work for refs.

For example, it can be used using _.debounce lodash function\nRequestAnimationFrame throttling: Changes based on requestAnimationFrame. For example, it can be used using raf-schd lodash function"},{"question":"How JSX prevents Injection Attacks?","answer":"React DOM escapes any values embedded in JSX before rendering them. Thus it ensures that you can never inject anything that\u2019s not explicitly written in your application. Everything is converted to a string before being rendered.For example, you can embed user input as below,javascript\n const name = response.potentiallyMaliciousInput;\n const element = <h1>{name}<\/h1>;This way you can prevent XSS(Cross-site-scripting) attacks in the application."},{"question":"How do you update rendered elements?","answer":"You can update UI(represented by rendered element) by passing the newly created element to ReactDOM's render method.For example, lets take a ticking clock example, where it updates the time by calling render method multiple times,```javascript\n function tick() {\n   const element = (\n     \nHello, world!\nIt is {new Date().toLocaleTimeString()}.\n\n   );\n   ReactDOM.render(element, document.getElementById(\"root\"));\n }setInterval(tick, 1000);\n ```"},{"question":"How do you say that props are readonly?","answer":"When you declare a component as a function or a class, it must never modify its own props.Let us take a below capital function,javascript\n function capital(amount, interest) {\n   return amount + interest;\n }The above function is called \u201cpure\u201d because it does not attempt to change their inputs, and always return the same result for the same inputs. Hence, React has a single rule saying \"All React components must act like pure functions with respect to their props.\""},{"question":"How do you say that state updates are merged?","answer":"When you call setState() in the component, React merges the object you provide into the current state.For example, let us take a facebook user with posts and comments details as state variables,javascript\n   constructor(props) {\n     super(props);\n     this.state = {\n       posts: [],\n       comments: []\n     };\n   }Now you can update them independently with separate setState() calls as below,```javascript\n  componentDidMount() {\n     fetchPosts().then(response => {\n       this.setState({\n         posts: response.posts\n       });\n     }); fetchComments().then(response => {\n   this.setState({\n     comments: response.comments\n   });\n });\n}\n ```As mentioned in the above code snippets, this.setState({comments}) updates only comments variable without modifying or replacing posts variable."},{"question":"How do you pass arguments to an event handler?","answer":"During iterations or loops, it is common to pass an extra parameter to an event handler.

Both Props and composition give you all the flexibility you need to customize a component\u2019s look and behavior explicitly and safely.\n Whereas, If you want to reuse non-UI functionality between components, it is suggested to extract it into a separate JavaScript module.

Even though many developers won't use this combination, it may require especially if you are using third-party UI components that are written using Web Components.For example, let us use Vaadin date picker web component as below,javascript\n import React, { Component } from \"react\";\n import \".\/App.css\";\n import \"@vaadin\/vaadin-date-picker\";\n class App extends Component {\n   render() {\n     return (\n       <div className=\"App\">\n         <vaadin-date-picker label=\"When were you born?\"><\/vaadin-date-picker>\n       <\/div>\n     );\n   }\n }\n export default App;"},{"question":"What is dynamic import?","answer":"You can achieve code-splitting in your app using dynamic import.Let's take an example of addition,\nNormal Import\njavascript\n import { add } from \".\/math\";\n console.log(add(10, 20));\nDynamic Import\njavascript\n import(\".\/math\").then((math) => {\n   console.log(math.add(10, 20));\n });"},{"question":"What are loadable components?","answer":"If you want to do code-splitting in a server rendered app, it is recommend to use Loadable Components because React.lazy and Suspense is not yet available for server-side rendering. Loadable lets you render a dynamic import as a regular component.Lets take an example,```javascript\n import loadable from \"@loadable\/component\";const OtherComponent = loadable(() => import(\".\/OtherComponent\"));function MyComponent() {\n   return (\n     \n\n\n   );\n }\n ```Now OtherComponent will be loaded in a separated bundle"},{"question":"What is suspense component?","answer":"If the module containing the dynamic import is not yet loaded by the time parent component renders, you must show some fallback content while you\u2019re waiting for it to load using a loading indicator. This can be done using Suspense component.For example, the below code uses suspense component,```javascript\n const OtherComponent = React.lazy(() => import(\".\/OtherComponent\"));function MyComponent() {\n   return (\n     \nLoading...\\}>\n         \n\n\n   );\n }\n ```As mentioned in the above code, Suspense is wrapped above the lazy component."},{"question":"What is route based code splitting?","answer":"One of the best place to do code splitting is with routes. The entire page is going to re-render at once so users are unlikely to interact with other elements in the page at the same time. Due to this, the user experience won't be disturbed.Let us take an example of route based website using libraries like React Router with React.lazy,```javascript\n import { BrowserRouter as Router, Route, Switch } from \"react-router-dom\";\n import React, { Suspense, lazy } from \"react\";const Home = lazy(() => import(\".\/routes\/Home\"));\n const About = lazy(() => import(\".\/routes\/About\"));const App = () => (\n   \nLoading...\\}>\n       \n\n\n\n\n\n );\n ```In the above code, the code splitting will happen at each route level."},{"question":"Give an example on How to use context?","answer":"Context is designed to share data that can be considered global for a tree of React components.For example, in the code below lets manually thread through a \u201ctheme\u201d prop in order to style the Button component.javascript\n \/\/Lets create a context with a default theme value \"luna\"\n const ThemeContext = React.createContext(\"luna\");\n \/\/ Create App component where it uses provider to pass theme value in the tree\n class App extends React.Component {\n   render() {\n     return (\n       <ThemeContext.Provider value=\"nova\">\n         <Toolbar \/>\n       <\/ThemeContext.Provider>\n     );\n   }\n }\n \/\/ A middle component where you don't need to pass theme prop anymore\n function Toolbar(props) {\n   return (\n     <div>\n       <ThemedButton \/>\n     <\/div>\n   );\n }\n \/\/ Lets read theme value in the button component to use\n class ThemedButton extends React.Component {\n   static contextType = ThemeContext;\n   render() {\n     return <Button theme={this.context} \/>;\n   }\n }"},{"question":"What is the purpose of default value in context?","answer":"The defaultValue argument is only used when a component does not have a matching Provider above it in the tree. This can be helpful for testing components in isolation without wrapping them.Below code snippet provides default theme value as Luna.javascript\n const MyContext = React.createContext(defaultValue);"},{"question":"How do you use contextType?","answer":"ContextType is used to consume the context object. The contextType property can be used in two ways,\n\ncontextType as property of class:\n    The contextType property on a class can be assigned a Context object created by React.createContext(). After that, you can consume the nearest current value of that Context type using this.context in any of the lifecycle methods and render function.\nLets assign contextType property on MyClass as below,\njavascript\nclass MyClass extends React.Component {\n  componentDidMount() {\n    let value = this.context;\n    \/* perform a side-effect at mount using the value of MyContext *\/\n  }\n  componentDidUpdate() {\n    let value = this.context;\n    \/* ... *\/\n  }\n  componentWillUnmount() {\n    let value = this.context;\n    \/* ... *\/\n  }\n  render() {\n    let value = this.context;\n    \/* render something based on the value of MyContext *\/\n  }\n}\nMyClass.contextType = MyContext;\n\n\nStatic field\n    You can use a static class field to initialize your contextType using public class field syntax.\njavascript\nclass MyClass extends React.Component {\n  static contextType = MyContext;\n  render() {\n    let value = this.context;\n    \/* render something based on the value *\/\n  }\n}"},{"question":"What is a consumer?","answer":"A Consumer is a React component that subscribes to context changes. It requires a function as a child which receives current context value as argument and returns a react node. The value argument passed to the function will be equal to the value prop of the closest Provider for this context above in the tree.Lets take a simple example,javascript\n <MyContext.Consumer>\n   {value => \/* render something based on the context value *\/}\n <\/MyContext.Consumer>"},{"question":"How do you solve performance corner cases while using context?","answer":"The context uses reference identity to determine when to re-render, there are some gotchas that could trigger unintentional renders in consumers when a provider\u2019s parent re-renders.For example, the code below will re-render all consumers every time the Provider re-renders because a new object is always created for value.javascript\n class App extends React.Component {\n   render() {\n     return (\n       <Provider value={{ something: \"something\" }}>\n         <Toolbar \/>\n       <\/Provider>\n     );\n   }\n }This can be solved by lifting up the value to parent state,```javascript\n class App extends React.Component {\n   constructor(props) {\n     super(props);\n     this.state = {\n       value: { something: \"something\" },\n     };\n   }render() {\n     return (\n       \n\n\n     );\n   }\n }\n ```"},{"question":"What is the purpose of forward ref in HOCs?","answer":"Refs will not get passed through because ref is not a prop. It is handled differently by React just like key. If you add a ref to a HOC, the ref will refer to the outermost container component, not the wrapped component. In this case, you can use Forward Ref API. For example, we can explicitly forward refs to the inner FancyButton component using the React.forwardRef API.The below HOC logs all props,```javascript\n function logProps(Component) {\n   class LogProps extends React.Component {\n     componentDidUpdate(prevProps) {\n       console.log(\"old props:\", prevProps);\n       console.log(\"new props:\", this.props);\n     } render() {\n   const { forwardedRef, ...rest } = this.props;\n\n   \/\/ Assign the custom prop \"forwardedRef\" as a ref\n   return <Component ref={forwardedRef} {...rest} \/>;\n }\n}return React.forwardRef((props, ref) => {\n     return ;\n   });\n }\n ```Let's use this HOC to log all props that get passed to our \u201cfancy button\u201d component,```javascript\n class FancyButton extends React.Component {\n   focus() {\n     \/\/ ...\n   }\/\/ ...\n }\n export default logProps(FancyButton);\n ```Now let's create a ref and pass it to FancyButton component. In this case, you can set focus to button element.```javascript\n import FancyButton from \".\/FancyButton\";const ref = React.createRef();\n ref.current.focus();\n ;\n ```"},{"question":"Is ref argument available for all functions or class components?","answer":"Regular function or class components don\u2019t receive the ref argument, and ref is not available in props either. The second ref argument only exists when you define a component with React.forwardRef call."},{"question":"Why do you need additional care for component libraries while using forward refs?","answer":"When you start using forwardRef in a component library, you should treat it as a breaking change and release a new major version of your library. This is because your library likely has a different behavior such as what refs get assigned to, and what types are exported. These changes can break apps and other libraries that depend on the old behavior."},{"question":"How to create react class components without ES6?","answer":"If you don\u2019t use ES6 then you may need to use the create-react-class module instead. For default props, you need to define getDefaultProps() as a function on the passed object. Whereas for initial state, you have to provide a separate getInitialState method that returns the initial state.javascript\n var Greeting = createReactClass({\n   getDefaultProps: function () {\n     return {\n       name: \"Jhohn\",\n     };\n   },\n   getInitialState: function () {\n     return { message: this.props.message };\n   },\n   handleClick: function () {\n     console.log(this.state.message);\n   },\n   render: function () {\n     return <h1>Hello, {this.props.name}<\/h1>;\n   },\n });Note: If you use createReactClass then auto binding is available for all methods. i.e, You don't need to use .bind(this) with in constructor for event handlers."},{"question":"Is it possible to use react without JSX?","answer":"Yes, JSX is not mandatory for using React. Actually it is convenient when you don\u2019t want to set up compilation in your build environment. Each JSX element is just syntactic sugar for calling React.createElement(component, props, ...children).For example, let us take a greeting example with JSX,```javascript\n class Greeting extends React.Component {\n   render() {\n     return Hello {this.props.message};\n   }\n }ReactDOM.render(\n   ,\n   document.getElementById(\"root\")\n );\n ```You can write the same code without JSX as below,``javascript\n class Greeting extends React.Component {\n   render() {\n     return React.createElement(\"div\", null,Hello ${this.props.message}`);\n   }\n }ReactDOM.render(\n   React.createElement(Greeting, { message: \"World\" }, null),\n   document.getElementById(\"root\")\n );\n ```"},{"question":"What is diffing algorithm?","answer":"React needs to use algorithms to find out how to efficiently update the UI to match the most recent tree. The diffing algorithms is generating the minimum number of operations to transform one tree into another. However, the algorithms have a complexity in the order of O(n\u00b3) where n is the number of elements in the tree.In this case, displaying 1000 elements would require in the order of one billion comparisons. This is far too expensive. Instead, React implements a heuristic O(n) algorithm based on two assumptions:\nTwo elements of different types will produce different trees.\nThe developer can hint at which child elements may be stable across different renders with a key prop."},{"question":"What are the rules covered by diffing algorithm?","answer":"When diffing two trees, React first compares the two root elements. The behavior is different depending on the types of the root elements. It covers the below rules during reconciliation algorithm,\nElements Of Different Types:\n    Whenever the root elements have different types, React will tear down the old tree and build the new tree from scratch. For example, elements  to , or from  to  of different types lead a full rebuild.\n\nDOM Elements Of The Same Type:\n    When comparing two React DOM elements of the same type, React looks at the attributes of both, keeps the same underlying DOM node, and only updates the changed attributes. Lets take an example with same DOM elements except className attribute,\n```javascript\n\n\n```\n\n\nComponent Elements Of The Same Type:\n    When a component updates, the instance stays the same, so that state is maintained across renders. React updates the props of the underlying component instance to match the new element, and calls componentWillReceiveProps() and componentWillUpdate() on the underlying instance. After that, the render() method is called and the diff algorithm recurses on the previous result and the new result.\n\n\nRecursing On Children:\n    when recursing on the children of a DOM node, React just iterates over both lists of children at the same time and generates a mutation whenever there\u2019s a difference. For example, when adding an element at the end of the children, converting between these two trees works well.\n```javascript\n\nfirst\nsecond\n\n\nfirst\nsecond\nthird\n\n```\n\n\nHandling keys:\n    React supports a key attribute. When children have keys, React uses the key to match children in the original tree with children in the subsequent tree. For example, adding a key can make the tree conversion efficient,\n\n```javascript\n \nDuke\nVillanova\n\nConnecticut\nDuke\nVillanova\n\n ```"},{"question":"When do you need to use refs?","answer":"There are few use cases to go for refs,\nManaging focus, text selection, or media playback.\nTriggering imperative animations.\nIntegrating with third-party DOM libraries."},{"question":"Must prop be named as render for render props?","answer":"Even though the pattern named render props, you don\u2019t have to use a prop named render to use this pattern. i.e, Any prop that is a function that a component uses to know what to render is technically a \u201crender prop\u201d. Lets take an example with the children prop for render props,javascript\n <Mouse\n   children={(mouse) => (\n     <p>\n       The mouse position is {mouse.x}, {mouse.y}\n     <\/p>\n   )}\n \/>Actually children prop doesn\u2019t need to be named in the list of \u201cattributes\u201d in JSX element. Instead, you can keep it directly inside element,javascript\n <Mouse>\n   {(mouse) => (\n     <p>\n       The mouse position is {mouse.x}, {mouse.y}\n     <\/p>\n   )}\n <\/Mouse>While using this above technique(without any name), explicitly state that children should be a function in your propTypes.javascript\n Mouse.propTypes = {\n   children: PropTypes.func.isRequired,\n };"},{"question":"What are the problems of using render props with pure components?","answer":"If you create a function inside a render method, it negates the purpose of pure component. Because the shallow prop comparison will always return false for new props, and each render in this case will generate a new value for the render prop. You can solve this issue by defining the render function as instance method."},{"question":"How do you create HOC using render props?","answer":"You can implement most higher-order components (HOC) using a regular component with a render prop. For example, if you would prefer to have a withMouse HOC instead of a  component, you could easily create one using a regular  with a render prop.javascript\n function withMouse(Component) {\n   return class extends React.Component {\n     render() {\n       return (\n         <Mouse\n           render={(mouse) => <Component {...this.props} mouse={mouse} \/>}\n         \/>\n       );\n     }\n   };\n }This way render props gives the flexibility of using either pattern."},{"question":"What is windowing technique?","answer":"Windowing is a technique that only renders a small subset of your rows at any given time, and can dramatically reduce the time it takes to re-render the components as well as the number of DOM nodes created. If your application renders long lists of data then this technique is recommended. Both react-window and react-virtualized are popular windowing libraries which provides several reusable components for displaying lists, grids, and tabular data."},{"question":"How do you print falsy values in JSX?","answer":"The falsy values such as false, null, undefined, and true are valid children but they don't render anything. If you still want to display them then you need to convert it to string. Let's take an example on how to convert to a string,javascript\n <div>My JavaScript variable is {String(myVariable)}.<\/div>"},{"question":"What is the typical use case of portals?","answer":"React portals are very useful when a parent component has overflow: hidden or has properties that affect the stacking context (e.g. z-index, position, opacity) and you need to visually \u201cbreak out\u201d of its container.For example, dialogs, global message notifications, hovercards, and tooltips."},{"question":"How do you set default value for uncontrolled component?","answer":"In React, the value attribute on form elements will override the value in the DOM. With an uncontrolled component, you might want React to specify the initial value, but leave subsequent updates uncontrolled. To handle this case, you can specify a defaultValue attribute instead of value.javascript\n render() {\n   return (\n     <form onSubmit={this.handleSubmit}>\n       <label>\n         User Name:\n         <input\n           defaultValue=\"John\"\n           type=\"text\"\n           ref={this.input} \/>\n       <\/label>\n       <input type=\"submit\" value=\"Submit\" \/>\n     <\/form>\n   );\n }The same applies for select and textArea inputs. But you need to use defaultChecked for checkbox and radio inputs."},{"question":"What is your favorite React stack?","answer":"Even though the tech stack varies from developer to developer, the most popular stack is used in react boilerplate project code.

It allows React to interrupt a long-running render to handle a high-priority event. i.e, When you enabled concurrent Mode, React will keep an eye on other tasks that need to be done, and if there's something with a higher priority it will pause what it is currently rendering and let the other task finish first. You can enable this in two ways,```javascript\n \/\/ 1. Part of an app by wrapping with ConcurrentMode\n \n\n;\/\/ 2. Whole app using createRoot\n ReactDOM.unstable_createRoot(domNode).render();\n ```"},{"question":"What is the difference between async mode and concurrent mode?","answer":"Both refers the same thing. Previously concurrent Mode being referred to as \"Async Mode\" by React team. The name has been changed to highlight React\u2019s ability to perform work on different priority levels. So it avoids the confusion from other approaches to Async Rendering."},{"question":"Can I use javascript urls in react16.9?","answer":"Yes, you can use javascript: URLs but it will log a warning in the console.

It assumes that any function starting with \u201duse\u201d and a capital letter right after it is a Hook. In particular, the rule enforces that,\nCalls to Hooks are either inside a PascalCase function (assumed to be a component) or another useSomething function (assumed to be a custom Hook).\nHooks are called in the same order on every render."},{"question":"What is the difference between Imperative and Declarative in React?","answer":"Imagine a simple UI component, such as a \"Like\" button. When you tap it, it turns blue if it was previously grey, and grey if it was previously blue.The imperative way of doing this would be:javascript\n if (user.likes()) {\n   if (hasBlue()) {\n     removeBlue();\n     addGrey();\n   } else {\n     removeGrey();\n     addBlue();\n   }\n }Basically, you have to check what is currently on the screen and handle all the changes necessary to redraw it with the current state, including undoing the changes from the previous state. You can imagine how complex this could be in a real-world scenario.In contrast, the declarative approach would be:javascript\n if (this.state.liked) {\n   return <blueLike \/>;\n } else {\n   return <greyLike \/>;\n }Because the declarative approach separates concerns, this part of it only needs to handle how the UI should look in a sepecific state, and is therefore much simpler to understand."},{"question":"What are the benefits of using typescript with reactjs?","answer":"Below are some of the benefits of using typescript with Reactjs,\nIt is possible to use latest JavaScript features\nUse of interfaces for complex type definitions\nIDEs such as VS Code was made for TypeScript\nAvoid bugs with the ease of readability and Validation"},{"question":"How do you make sure that user remains authenticated on page refresh while using Context API State Management?","answer":"When a user logs in and reload, to persist the state generally we add the load user action in the useEffect hooks in the main App.js.

This can happen when you are trying to do some computations using a state variable and unknowingly save the result in the same state variable. This is the main reason why it is advised to return new instances of state variables from the reducers by using Object.assign({}, ...) or spread syntax.This can cause unknown issues in the UI as the value of the state variable got updated without telling React to check what all components were being affected from this update and it can cause UI bugs.Ex:```javascript\n class A extends React.component {\n   constructor(props) {\n     super(props);\n     this.state = {\n       loading: false\n     }\n  }componentDidMount() {\n   let { loading } = this.state;\n   loading = (() => true)(); \/\/ Trying to perform an operation and directly saving in a state variable\n }```How to prevent it: Make sure your state variables are immutable by either enforcing immutability by using plugins like Immutable.js, always using setState to make updates, and returning new instances in reducers when sending updated state values."},{"question":"What is the difference between useState and useRef hook?","answer":"useState causes components to re-render after state updates whereas useRef doesn\u2019t cause a component to re-render when the value or state changes.\n    Essentially, useRef is like a \u201cbox\u201d that can hold a mutable value in its (.current) property.\nuseState allows us to update the state inside components. While useRef allows referencing DOM elements."},{"question":"What is a wrapper component?","answer":"A wrapper in React is a component that wraps or surrounds another component or group of components. It can be used for a variety of purposes such as adding additional functionality, styling, or layout to the wrapped components.For example, consider a simple component that displays a message:javascript\n const Message = ({ text }) => {\n   return <p>{text}<\/p>;\n };We can create a wrapper component that will add a border to the message component:javascript\n const MessageWrapper = (props) => {\n   return (\n     <div style={{ border: \"1px solid black\" }}>\n       <Message {...props} \/>\n     <\/div>\n   );\n };Now we can use the MessageWrapper component instead of the Message component and the message will be displayed with a border:javascript\n <MessageWrapper text=\"Hello World\" \/>Wrapper component can also accept its own props and pass them down to the wrapped component, for example, we can create a wrapper component that will add a title to the message component:javascript\n const MessageWrapperWithTitle = ({title, ...props}) => {\n   return (\n     <div>\n       <h3>{title}<\/h3>\n       <Message {...props} \/>\n     <\/div>\n   );\n };Now we can use the MessageWrapperWithTitle component and pass title props:javascript\n <MessageWrapperWithTitle title=\"My Message\" text=\"Hello World\" \/>This way, the wrapper component can add additional functionality, styling, or layout to the wrapped component while keeping the wrapped component simple and reusable."},{"question":"What are the differences between useEffect and useLayoutEffect hooks?","answer":"useEffect and useLayoutEffect are both React hooks that can be used to synchronize a component with an external system, such as a browser API or a third-party library. However, there are some key differences between the two:\n\nTiming: useEffect runs after the browser has finished painting, while useLayoutEffect runs synchronously before the browser paints. This means that useLayoutEffect can be used to measure and update layout in a way that feels more synchronous to the user.\n\n\nBrowser Paint: useEffect allows browser to paint the changes before running the effect, hence it may cause some visual flicker. useLayoutEffect synchronously runs the effect before browser paints and hence it will avoid visual flicker.\n\n\nExecution Order: The order in which multiple useEffect hooks are executed is determined by React and may not be predictable. However, the order in which multiple useLayoutEffect hooks are executed is determined by the order in which they were called.\n\n\nError handling: useEffect has a built-in mechanism for handling errors that occur during the execution of the effect, so that it does not crash the entire application. useLayoutEffect does not have this mechanism, and errors that occur during the execution of the effect will crash the entire application.\n\nIn general, it's recommended to use useEffect as much as possible, because it is more performant and less prone to errors. useLayoutEffect should only be used when you need to measure or update layout, and you can't achieve the same result using useEffect."},{"question":"What are the differences between Functional and Class Components?","answer":"There are two different ways to create components in ReactJS. The main differences are listed down as below,## 1.  Syntax:The classs components uses ES6 classes to create the components. It uses render function to display the HTML content in the webpage.The syntax for class component looks like as below.\n    ```js\n    class App extends Reacts.Component {\n      render(){\n        return This is a class component}\n      }```\nNote: The Pascal Case is the recommended approach to provide naming to a component.Functional component has been improved over the years with some added features like Hooks. Here is a syntax for functional component.```js\n  function App(){\n    return \nHello, I'm a function component\n\n  }```## 2. State:State contains information or data about a component which may change over time. In class component, you can update the state when a user interacts with it or server updates the data using the setState() method. The initial state is going to be assigned in the Constructor( )method using the the this.state object and it is possible to different data types in the this.state object such as string, boolean, numbers, etc.\n  A simple example showing how we use the setState() and constructor()```js\n  class App extends Component {\n    constructor() {\n      super();\n      this.state = {\n        message: \"This is a class component\",\n      };\n    }\n    updateMessage() {\n      this.setState({t\n        message: \"Updating the class component\",\n      });\n    }\n    render() {\n      return (\n        <>\n          {this.state.message}\n {\n              this.updateMessage();\n            }}>\n            Click!!\n          \n\n      );\n    }\n  }```You not use state in functional components because it was only supported in class components. But over the years hooks have been implemented in functional component which enable to use state in functional component too.The useState() hook can used to implement state in funcitonal component. It returns an array with two items: the first item is current state and the next one is a function (setState) that updates the value of the current state. Let's see an example to demonstrate the state in functional components,js\n  function App() {\n    const [message, setMessage] = useState(\"This is a functional component\");\n    const updateMessage = () => {\n      setCountry(\"Updating the functional component\");\n    };\n    return (\n      <div className=\"App\">\n        <h1>{message} <\/h1>\n        <button onClick={updateMessage}>Click me!!<\/button>\n      <\/div>\n    );\n  }## 4. Props:\n  Props are referred to as \"properties\". The props are passed into react component just like arguments passed to a function. In otherwords, they are similar to HTML attributes. The props are accessible in child class component using this.props as shown in below example,\n  ```js\n  class Child extends React.Component {\n    render() {\n      return  This is a functional component and component name is {this.props.name} ;\n    }\n  }class Parent extends React.Component {\n    render() {\n           return (\n              \n\n\n\n            );\n     }\n  }\n  ```Props in functional components are similar to that of the class components but the difference is the absence of 'this' keyword. ```js\n  function Child(props) {\n    return This is a child component and the component name is{props.name};\n  }function Parent() {\n    return (\n      \n\n\n\n    );\n  }\n  ```"},{"question":"Why does strict mode render twice in React?","answer":"StrictMode renders components twice in development mode(not production) in order to detect any problems with your code and warn you about those problems. This is used to detect accidental side effects in the render phase.  If you used `create-react-app` development tool then it automatically enables StrictMode by default.\njs\n  ReactDOM.render(\n    <React.StrictMode>\n      {App}\n    <\/React.StrictMode>,\n    document.getElementById('root')\n  );If you want to disable this behavior then you can remove strict mode.\n  js\n  ReactDOM.render(\n    {App}, \n    document.getElementById('root')\n  );To detect side effects the following functions are invoked twice:\nClass component constructor, render, and shouldComponentUpdate methods\nClass component static getDerivedStateFromProps method\nFunction component bodies\nState updater functions\nFunctions passed to useState, useMemo, or useReducer (any Hook)"},{"question":"What is the difference between String and string in C#?","answer":"string is an alias in C# for System.String. So technically, there is no difference. It's like int vs. System.Int32.As far as guidelines, it's generally recommended to use string any time you're referring to an object.\ncsharp\nstring place = \"world\";Likewise, it's generally recommended to use String if you need to refer specifically to the class.\ncsharp\nstring greet = String.Format(\"Hello {0}!\", place);"},{"question":"What is .NET Standard?","answer":"The .NET Standard is a formal specification of .NET APIs that are intended to be available on all .NET implementations."},{"question":"What is .NET Core?","answer":"The .NET Core platform is a new .NET stack that is optimized for open source development and agile delivery on NuGet. .NET Core has two major components.

A DataView provides a dynamic view of data whose content, ordering, and membership reflect changes to the underlying DataTable as they occur. This is different from the Select method of the DataTable, which returns a DataRow array from a table per particular filter and\/or sort order and whose content reflects changes to the underlying table, but whose membership and ordering remain static.

Data Adapters form the bridge between a data source and a dataset. The DataAdapter also resolves changes made to the DataSet back to the data source. The DataAdapter uses the Connection object of the .NET Framework data provider to connect to a data source, and it uses Command objects to retrieve data from and resolve changes to the data source.A DataAdapter supports mainly the following two methods:\nFill(): The Fill method populates a dataset or a data table object with data from the database. It retrieves rows from the data source using the SELECT statement specified by an associated select command property. The Fill method leaves the connection in the same state as it encountered before populating the data.     \nUpdate(): The Update method commits the changes back to the database.

With tools like\u00a0Serilog,\u00a0you can extend your logging\u00a0easily\u00a0and save your logs to file, Azure, Amazon or any other output provider. You can configure verbosity and log levels via configuration (appsettings.json by default), and you can configure log levels by different categories."},{"question":"Explain startup process in ASP.NET Core?","answer":"Everything starts from Program.cs\n```csharp\npublic static void Main(string[] args)\n{\n    BuildWebHost(args).Run();\n}public static IWebHost BuildWebHost(string[] args) =>\n    WebHost.CreateDefaultBuilder(args)\n        .UseStartup()\n        .Build();\n```CreateDefaultBuilder extension method will create a default configuration which will look first into appsettings.json files then will look for Environment variables and at the end, it will use command line arguments.This part will also set up default logger sources (debug and console) and load the settings for logging from appsettings.json.After the\u00a0CreateDefaultBuilder finishes, then Startup class is executed. First, the constructor code is executed. After that, services are added to DI container via AddServices method that lives in Startup class. After that, an order of middleware that will handle every incoming request is set up."},{"question":"What exactly is an application pool? What is its purpose?","answer":"Application pools allow you to isolate your applications from one another, even if they are running on the same server. This way, if there is an error in one app, it won't take down other applications.Additionally, applications pools allow you to separate different apps which require different levels of security."},{"question":"How you can add an event handler?","answer":"** **Using the Attributes property of server side control. e.g. \ncsharp\nbtnSubmit.Attributes.Add(\"onMouseOver\",\"JavascriptCode();\")"},{"question":"What's the use of Response.Output.Write()?","answer":"We can write formatted output using Response.Output.Write()."},{"question":"How to configure your ASP.NET Core app?","answer":"Another crucial part of ASP.NET Core Framework is Configuration. Also, it is part of Dependency Injection. Use it anywhere in your code with an option to\u00a0reload on changes\u00a0of configuration values from sources (appsettings.json, environment variables, command line arguments, etc.). It is also easy to override, extend and customize the Configuration.

You define the page(s) of a site, drop in the controls, and provide the programmatic plumbing to make it all work.ASP.NET MVC is an application framework based on the Model-View-Controller architectural pattern. This is what might be considered a \"canned\" framework for a specific way of implementing a web site, with a page acting as the \"controller\" and dispatching requests to the appropriate pages in the application. The idea is to \"partition\" the various elements of the application, eg business rules, presentation rules, and so on.Think of the former as the \"blank slate\" for implementing a site architecture you've designed more or less from the ground up. MVC provides a mechanism for designing a site around a pre-determined \"pattern\" of application access, if that makes sense. There's more technical detail to it than that, to be sure, but that's the nickel tour for the purposes of the question."},{"question":"What is ViewState?","answer":"View State is the method to preserve the Value of the Page and Controls between round trips. It is a Page-Level State Management technique. View State is turned on by default and normally serializes the data in every control on the page regardless of whether it is actually used during a post-back.  A web application is stateless. That means that a new instance of a page is created every time when we make a request to the server to get the page and after the round trip our page has been lost immediately"},{"question":"Can ASP.NET Core work with the .NET framework?","answer":"Yes. This might surprise many, but ASP.NET Core works with .NET framework and this is officially supported by Microsoft.ASP.NET Core works with:\n.NET Core framework\n.NET framework"},{"question":"What is the good practice to implement validations in aspx page?","answer":"Client-side validation is the best way to validate data of a web page. It reduces the network traffic and saves server resources."},{"question":"What is a postback?","answer":"A postback originates from the client browser. Usually one of the controls on the page will be manipulated by the user (a button clicked or dropdown changed, etc), and this control will initiate a postback. The state of this control, plus all other controls on the page (known as the View State) is Posted Back to the web server."},{"question":"What is the file extension of ASP.NET web service?","answer":"Web services have file extension .asmx.[\u2b06] ASP.NET MVC Interview Questions"},{"question":"What is Layout in MVC?","answer":"Layout pages are similar to master pages in traditional web forms. This is used to set the common look across multiple pages. In each child page we can find\u200a\u2014html\n@{\nLayout = \u201c~\/Views\/Shared\/TestLayout1.cshtml\u201d;\n}This indicates child page uses TestLayout page as it\u2019s master page."},{"question":"Explain Bundle.Config in MVC4?","answer":"\u201cBundleConfig.cs\u201d in MVC4 is used to register the bundles by the bundling and minification system. Many bundles are added by default including jQuery libraries like\u200a\u2014\u200ajquery.validate, Modernizr, and default CSS references."},{"question":"What is Razor View Engine?","answer":"Razor is the first major update to render HTML in MVC 3. Razor was designed specifically for view engine syntax. Main focus of this would be to simplify and code-focused templating for HTML generation. Below is the sample of using Razor:```html\n@model MvcMusicStore.Models.Customer\n@{ViewBag.Title = \u201cGet Customers\u201d;} @Model.CustomerName \n```\n\n\n\n#### What is the use of ViewModel in MVC? \nViewModel is a plain class with properties, which is used to bind it to strongly typed view. ViewModel can have the validation rules defined for its properties using data annotations.\n\n\n#### What you mean by Routing in MVC? \n**Routing** is a pattern matching mechanism of incoming requests to the URL patterns which are registered in route table. Class\u200a\u2014\u200a\u201cUrlRoutingModule\u201d is used for the same process.\n\n\n#### What are Actions in MVC? \n**Actions** are the methods in Controller class which is responsible for returning the view or json data. Action will mainly have return type\u200a\u2014\u200a\u201cActionResult\u201d and it will be invoked from method\u200a\u2014\u200a\u201cInvokeAction()\u201d called by controller.\n\n\n#### What are the advantages of MVC over ASP.NET? \n* Provides a clean separation of concerns among UI (Presentation layer), model (Transfer objects\/Domain Objects\/Entities) and Business Logic (Controller).\n* Easy to UNIT Test\n* Improved reusability of model and views. We can have multiple views which can point to the same model and vice versa.\n* Improved structuring of the code\n\n\n#### What are Scaffold templates in MVC? \nScaffolding in ASP.NET MVC is used to generate the Controllers, Model and Views for create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) functionality in an application. The scaffolding will be knowing the naming conventions used for models and controllers and views.\n\n\n#### Can you explain Model, Controller and View in MVC? \n* **Model**\u200a\u2014\u200aIt\u2019s a business entity and it is used to represent the application data.\n* **Controller**\u200a\u2014\u200aRequest sent by the user always scatters through controller and it\u2019s responsibility is to redirect to the specific view using View() method.\n* **View**\u200a\u2014\u200aIt\u2019s the presentation layer of MVC.\n\n\n#### What is Razor Pages? \n[Razor Pages](https:\/\/codingblast.com\/asp-net-core-razor-pages\/) is a new feature of ASP.NET Core that makes coding page-focused scenarios easier and more productive.\n\nWith Razor Pages, you have this one Razor file (_.cshtml_), and the code for a single page lives inside of that file, and that file also represents the URL structure of the app. Therefore, you got everything inside of one file, and it just works.\n\nHowever, you can separate your code to the _code behind_ file with _.cshtml.cs_ extension. You would usually have your view model and handlers (like action methods in MVC) in that file and handle the logic there. Of course, you could also have your view model moved to separate place.\n\nSince Razor Pages is part of the MVC stack, you can use anything that comes with MVC inside of our Razor Pages.\n\n\n#### Explain Sections is MVC? \nSection are the part of HTML which is to be rendered in layout page. In Layout page we will use the below syntax for rendering the HTML \u2013\n\n```html\n@RenderSection(\u201cTestSection\u201d)\n```\n\nAnd in child pages we are defining these sections as shown below \u2013\n\n```html\n@section TestSection{\n     Test Content\n}\n```\n\n\n#### What are Non Action methods in MVC? \nIn MVC all public methods have been treated as Actions. So if you are creating a method and if you do not want to use it as an action method then the method has to be decorated with \"NonAction\" attribute as shown below:\n\n```csharp\n[NonAction]\npublic void TestMethod()\n{\n   \/\/ Method logic\n}\n```\n\n\n## [[\u2b06]](#toc) ASP.NET Web API Interview Questions\n#### What is ASP.NET Web API? \nASP.NET Web API is a framework that simplifies building HTTP services for broader range of clients (including browsers as well as mobile devices) on top of .NET Framework.\n\nUsing ASP.NET Web API, we can create non-SOAP based services like plain XML or JSON strings, etc. with many other advantages including:\n\n*   Create resource-oriented services using the full features of HTTP\n*   Exposing services to a variety of clients easily like browsers or mobile devices, etc.\n\n\n#### Which status code used for all uncaught exceptions by default? \n**500** \u2013 Internal Server Error\n\nConsider:\n```csharp\n[Route(\"CheckId\/{id}\")]\n[HttpGet]\npublic IHttpActionResult CheckId(int id)\n{\n    if(id > 100)\n    {\n        throw new ArgumentOutOfRangeException();\n    }\n    return Ok(id);\n}\n```\nAnd the result:\n\n\n\n\n\n#### What are the Advantages of Using ASP.NET Web API? \nUsing ASP.NET Web API has a number of advantages, but core of the advantages are:\n\n*   It works the HTTP way using standard HTTP verbs like `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE`, etc. for all CRUD operations\n*   Complete support for routing\n*   Response generated in JSON or XML format using `MediaTypeFormatter`\n*   It has the ability to be hosted in IIS as well as self-host outside of IIS\n*   Supports Model binding and Validation\n*   Support for OData\n\n\n#### What New Features are Introduced in ASP.NET Web API 2.0? \nMore new features introduced in ASP.NET Web API framework v2.0 are as follows:\n\n*   Attribute Routing\n*   External Authentication\n*   CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)\n*   OWIN (Open Web Interface for .NET) Self Hosting\n*   `IHttpActionResult`\n*   Web API OData\n\n\n#### What exactly is OAuth (Open Authorization)? \n**OAuth** (Open Authorization) is an open standard for access granting\/deligation protocol. It used as a way for Internet users to grant websites or applications access to their information on other websites but without giving them the passwords. It does not deal with authentication.\n\nBasically there are three parties involved: oAuth Provider, oAuth Client and Owner.\n\n* oAuth Client (Application Which wants to access your credential)\n* oAuth Provider (eg. facebook, twitter...)\n* Owner (the person with facebook,twitter.. account )\n\n\n#### Explain the usage of HttpResponseMessage? \n`HttpResponseMessage` works with HTTP protocol to return the data with status\/error. \n\n\n#### What is the difference between ApiController and Controller? \n* Use **Controller** to render your normal views. \n* **ApiController** action only return data that is serialized and sent to the client.\n\nConsider:\n```csharp\npublic class TweetsController : Controller {\n  \/\/ GET: \/Tweets\/\n  [HttpGet]\n  public ActionResult Index() {\n    return Json(Twitter.GetTweets(), JsonRequestBehavior.AllowGet);\n  }\n}\n```\nor\n```csharp\npublic class TweetsController : ApiController {\n  \/\/ GET: \/Api\/Tweets\/\n  public List Get() {\n    return Twitter.GetTweets();\n  }\n}\n```\n\n\n#### What are main return types supported in Web API? \nA Web API controller action can return following values:\n\n*   Void \u2013 It will return empty content\n*   HttpResponseMessage \u2013 It will convert the response to an HTTP message.\n*   IHttpActionResult \u2013 internally calls ExecuteAsync to create an HttpResponseMessage\n*   Other types \u2013 You can write the serialized return value into the response body\n\n\n## [[\u2b06]](#toc) AWS Interview Questions\n#### What is AWS? \n**AWS** stands for Amazon Web Services and is a platform that provides database storage, secure cloud services, offering to compute power, content delivery, and many other services to develop business levels.\n\n\n#### Explain the key components of AWS? \n* **Simple Storage Service (S3)**: S3 is most widely used AWS storage web service.\n* **Simple E-mail Service (SES)**: SES is a hosted transactional email service and allows one to fluently send deliverable emails using a RESTFUL API call or through a regular SMTP.\n* **Identity and Access Management (IAM)**: IAM provides improved identity and security management for AWS account.\n* **Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2)**: EC2 is an AWS ecosystem central piece. It is responsible for providing on-demand and flexible computing resources with a \u201cpay as you go\u201d pricing model.\n* **Elastic Block Store (EBS)**: EBS offers continuous storage solution that can be seen in instances as a regular hard drive.\n* **CloudWatch**: CloudWatch allows the controller to outlook and gather key metrics and also set a series of alarms to be notified if there is any trouble.\n\n\n#### What is buckets in AWS? \nAn Amazon S3 bucket is a public cloud storage resource available in Amazon Web Services' (AWS) Simple Storage Service (S3), an object storage offering. Amazon S3 buckets, which are similar to file folders, store objects, which consist of data and its descriptive metadata.\n\nBy default, you can create up to 100 buckets in each of your AWS accounts. If you need more buckets, you can increase your bucket limit by submitting a service limit increase.\n\n\n#### What is AWS Cloudfront? \nAmazon **CloudFront** is a content delivery network (CDN) offered by Amazon Web Services. Content delivery networks provide a globally-distributed network of proxy servers which cache content, such as web videos or other bulky media, more locally to consumers, thus improving access speed for downloading the content.\n\n\n#### What do you mean by AMI? What does it include? \n**AMI** stands for the term **Amazon Machine Image**.  It\u2019s an AWS template which provides the information (an application server, and operating system, and applications) required to perform the launch of an instance. This AMI is the copy of the AMI that is running in the cloud as a virtual server.  You can launch instances from as many different AMIs as you need. AMI consists of the followings:\n\n* A root volume template for an existing instance\n* Launch permissions to determine which AWS accounts will get the AMI in order to launch the instances\n* Mapping for block device to calculate the total volume that will be attached to the instance at the time of launch\n\n\n#### How can I download a file from EC2? \nUse scp:\n\n```sh\nscp -i ec2key.pem username@ec2ip:\/path\/to\/file .\n```\n\n\n#### Is it possible to clone a EC2 instance data? \nYou can make an AMI of an existing instance, and then launch other instances using that AMI.\n\n\n#### What is AWS Data Pipeline? \n**AWS Data Pipeline** is a web service that you can use to automate the movement and transformation of data. With AWS Data Pipeline, you can define data-driven workflows, so that tasks can be dependent on the successful completion of previous tasks.\n\n\n#### Explain the features of Amazon EC2 services \nAmazon EC2 services have following features:\n\n* Virtual Computing Environments\n* Proffers Persistent storage volumes\n* Firewall validating you to specify the protocol\n* Pre-configured templates\n* Static IP address for dynamic Cloud Computing\n\n\n#### What is the connection between AMI and Instance? \nMany different types of *instances* can be launched from one *AMI*. The type of an instance generally regulates the hardware components of the host computer that is used for the instance. Each type of instance has distinct computing and memory efficacy.\n\nOnce an instance is launched, it casts as host and the user interaction with it is same as with any other computer but we have a completely controlled access to our instances. AWS developer interview questions may contain one or more AMI based questions, so prepare yourself for the AMI topic very well.\n\n\n#### Are S3 buckets region specific? \nYes, buckets exist in a specific region and you need to specify that region when you create a bucket. Amazon S3 creates bucket in a region you specify. You can choose any AWS region that is geographically close to you to optimize latency, minimize costs, or address regulatory requirements.\n\n\n#### What is AWS Direct Connect? \n**AWS Direct Connect** bypasses the public Internet and establishes a secure, dedicated connection from your infrastructure into AWS. With established connectivity via AWS Direct Connect, you can access your Amazon VPC and all AWS services.\n\n\n#### What is AWS EBS? \n**Amazon Elastic Block Store** (Amazon EBS) provides persistent block storage volumes for use with Amazon EC2 instances in the AWS Cloud. Each Amazon EBS volume is automatically replicated within its Availability Zone to protect you from component failure, offering high availability and durability.\n\n\n#### What is AWS Lambda? \n**AWS Lambda** is a serverless compute service that runs your code in response to events and automatically manages the underlying compute resources for you. You can use AWS Lambda to extend other AWS services with custom logic, or create your own back-end services that operate at AWS scale, performance, and security.\n\n\n#### What is AWS DynamoDB? \n**Amazon DynamoDB** is a fully managed NoSQL database service that provides fast and predictable performance with seamless scalability. With DynamoDB, you can create database tables that can store and retrieve any amount of data, and serve any level of request traffic.\n\n\n#### What is AWS EMR? \n**Amazon Elastic MapReduce (EMR)** is an Amazon Web Services (AWS) tool for big data processing and analysis. Amazon EMR offers the expandable low-configuration service as an easier alternative to running in-house cluster computing.\n\nAmazon EMR is based on Apache Hadoop, a Java-based programming framework that supports the processing of large data sets in a distributed computing environment. MapReduce is a software framework that allows developers to write programs that process massive amounts of unstructured data in parallel across a distributed cluster of processors or stand-alone computers.\n\n\n#### Is data stored in S3 is always encrypted? \nBy default data on S3 is not encrypted, but all you could enable server-side encryption in your object metadata when you upload your data to Amazon S3. As soon as your data reaches S3, it is encrypted and stored.\n\n\n#### Can we attach single EBS to multiple EC2s same time? \nNo. After you create a volume, you can attach it to any EC2 instance in the same Availability Zone. An EBS volume can be attached to **only one EC2 instance at a time**, but multiple volumes can be attached to a single instance.\n\n\n#### What is AWS API gateway? \nAmazon **API Gateway** is an AWS service that enables developers to create, publish, maintain, monitor, and secure APIs at any scale. You can create APIs that access AWS or other web services, as well as data stored in the AWS Cloud.\n\n\n#### What is AWS Direct Connect? \nUsing **AWS Direct Connect**, you can establish private connectivity between AWS and your datacenter, office, or colocation environment, which in many cases can reduce your network costs, increase bandwidth throughput, and provide a more consistent network experience than Internet-based connections.\n\n\n## [[\u2b06]](#toc) Agile & Scrum Interview Questions\n#### What is ASP.NET MVC? \nASP.NET MVC is a web application Framework. It is light weight and highly testable Framework. MVC separates application into three components\u200a\u2014\u200aModel, View and Controller.\n\n\n#### What is Scrum? \n**Scrum** is one of the most popular frameworks for implementing *Agile*. Many people think scrum and agile are the same thing but they're not.\n\nWith scrum, the product is built in a series of fixed-length iterations called sprints that give teams a framework for shipping software on a regular cadence.\n\n\n#### What is sprint in Scrum? \nIn the Scrum methodology a **sprint** is the basic unit of development. Scrum sprints correspond to Agile iterations. \n\nEach sprint starts with \n* a **planning meeting**, where the tasks for the sprint are identified and an estimated commitment for the **sprint goal** is made. \n\nA Sprint ends with \n* a **review or retrospective meeting** where the progress is reviewed and lessons for the next sprint are identified. During each sprint, the team creates finished portions of a product.\n\n\n#### Name roles in Scrum \nThree essential roles for scrum success are:\n* **The Product Owner** are the champions for their product. They are focused on understanding business and market requirements, then prioritizing the work to be done by the engineering team accordingly.\n* ** The Scrum Master** are the champion for scrum within their team. They coach the team, the product owner, and the business on the scrum process and look for ways to fine-tune their practice of it.\n* **The Scrum Team** are the champions for sustainable development practices. Scrum teams are cross-functional, \"the development team\" includes testers, designers, and ops engineers in addition to developers. \n\n\n#### What is User Stories? \n**User stories** are features customers might want to see in their software. They are written on index cards to encourage face-to-face communication. Typically no more than a couple days work, they form the basis of our Agile plans.\n\n#### What is an epic, user stories and task? \n**Epic:** A customer described software feature that is itemized in the product backlog is known as epic. Epics are sub-divided into stories.\n\n**User Stories:** From the client perspective user stories are prepared which defines project or business functions, and it is delivered in a particular sprint as expected.\n\n**Task:** Further down user stories are broken down into different task\n\n\n#### Explain what is Refactoring? \nTo improve the performance, the existing code is modified; this is re-factoring. During re-factoring the code functionality remains same.\n\n\n#### What is an Agile iteration? \nAn Agile **iteration** is a short one to two week period where a team takes most important user stories,  builds them completely and deliver as running-tested-software to the customer. Analysis, design, coding, testing happen during an iteration.\n\n#### Name some types of meetings or ceremonies in Scrum \nScrum calls for four ceremonies that bring structure to each sprint:\n\n* **Sprint planning**: A team planning meeting that determines what to complete in the coming sprint.\n* **Daily stand-up**: Also known as a daily scrum, a 15-minute mini-meeting for the software team to sync.\n* **Sprint demo**: A sharing meeting where the team shows what they've shipped in that sprint.\n* **Sprint retrospective**: A review of what did and didn't go well with actions to make the next sprint better.\n\n\n\n#### If a timebox plan needs to be reprioritized who should re-prioritise it? \nIf a timebox plan needs to be reprioritized it should include whole team, product owner, and developers.\n\n\n#### Mention the key difference between sprint backlog and product backlog? \n* **Product backlog**: It contains a list of all desired features and is owned by the product owner\n\n* **Sprint backlog**: It is a subset of the product backlog owned by development team and commits to deliver it in a sprint. It is created in Sprint Planning Meeting\n\n\n#### What is Agile? \n**Agile** is a time boxed, **iterative approach (framework) to software delivery** that builds software incrementally from the start of the project, instead of trying to deliver it all at once near the end.\n\nIt works by breaking projects down into little bits of user functionality called **user stories**, prioritizing them, and then continuously delivering them in short two week cycles called **iterations**.\n\nAgile refers to any process that aligns with the concepts of the [Agile Manifesto](http:\/\/agilemanifesto.org\/). \n\n\n#### Explain in Agile, burn-up and burn-down chart? \nTo track the project progress burnup and burn down, charts are used\n\n* Burnup Chart: It shows the progress of stories done over time\n* Burndown Chart: It shows how much work was left to do overtime\n\n\n#### What is Sprint Planning? \nThe work to be performed in the Sprint is planned at the **Sprint Planning**. This plan is created by the collaborative work of the entire Scrum Team.\n\nSprint Planning answers the following:\n\n* What can be delivered in the Increment resulting from the upcoming Sprint?\n* How will the work needed to deliver the Increment be achieved?\n\nThe Sprint Goal is an objective set for the Sprint that can be met through the implementation of Product Backlog. \n\n\n#### Explain difference between a Product and a Sprint Backlog \n* The **Product Backlog** is an ordered list of everything that is known to be needed in the product. It is the single source of requirements for any changes to be made to the product.\n\n* The **Sprint Backlog** is the set of Product Backlog items selected for the Sprint during the Sprint Planning, plus a plan for delivering the product Increment and realizing the Sprint Goal. \n\n\n#### What is story points\/efforts\/ scales? \nIt is used to discuss the difficulty of the story without assigning actual hours. The most common scale used is a Fibonacci sequence (1, 2, 3, 5, 8,1 3,\u2026.100) although some teams use linear scale (1, 2, 3, 4\u2026.), Powers of 2 (1, 2, 4, 8\u2026\u2026) and cloth size (XS, S ,M, L, XL)\n\n\n#### How is Agile different from other software delivery aproaches? \n* Analysis, design, coding, and testing are continuous activities\n* Development is iterative\n* Planning is adaptive\n* Roles blur\n* Scope can vary\n* Requirements can change\n* Working software is the primary measure of success\n\n\n\n#### Have you ever used Scrum Task Board? \nIn Scrum the *task board* is a visual display of the progress of the Scrum team during a sprint. It presents a snapshot of the current sprint backlog allowing everyone to see which tasks remain to be started, which are in progress and which are done.\n\nConsider the following layout of the task board:\n- Stories\n- To Do\n- In Progress\n- Testing\n- Done\n\n\n#### Explain what does it mean by product roadmap? \nA **product roadmap** is referred for the holistic view of product features that create the product vision.\n\n\n#### Explain what is Velocity in Agile? \n**Velocity** is a metric that is calculated by addition of all efforts estimates related with user stories completed in an iteration. It figures out how much work Agile can complete in a sprint and how much time will it need to finish a project.\n\n\n#### Mention what should a burndown chart should highlight? \nThe burn-down chart shows the remaining work to complete before the timebox (iteration) ends.\n\n\n#### What is test driven development? \n**Test driven development (TDD)** is also known as test-driven design. In this method, developer first writes an automated test case which describes new function or improvement and then creates small codes to pass that test, and later re-factors the new code to meet the acceptable standards.\n\n\n## [[\u2b06]](#toc) Android Interview Questions\n#### Mention the difference between RelativeLayout and LinearLayout? \n* **Linear Layout** \u2014 Arranges elements either vertically or horizontally. i.e. in a row or column.\n* **Relative Layout** \u2014 Arranges elements relative to parent or other elements.\n\n\n#### What is the difference between Bitmap and Drawable in Android? \n* A **Bitmap** is a representation of a bitmap image (something like java.awt.Image).\n* A **Drawable** is an abstraction of \"something that can be drawn\". It could be a Bitmap (wrapped up as a BitmapDrawable), but it could also be a solid color, a collection of other Drawable objects, or any number of other structures.\n\n\n#### What is a difference between Spannable and String? \nA **Spannable** allows to attach formatting information like bold, italic, ... to sub-sequences (\"spans\", thus the name) of the characters. It can be used whenever you want to represent \"rich text\".\n\n\n#### What is an Activity? \nAn **activity** provides the window in which the app draws its UI. This window typically fills the screen, but may be smaller than the screen and float on top of other windows. Generally, one activity implements one screen in an app. For instance, one of an app\u2019s activities may implement a Preferences screen, while another activity implements a Select Photo screen.\n\n\n#### What is Armv7? \nThere are 3 CPU architectures in Android:\n\n* **_ARMv7_**  is the most common as it is optimised for battery consumption.\n*  **_ARM64_**  is an evolved version of that that supports 64-bit processing for more powerful computing.\n*  **_ARMx86_**, is the least used for these three, since it is not battery friendly. It is more powerful than the other two.\n\n\n#### Explain activity lifecycle \nAs a user navigates through, out of, and back to your app, the Activity instances in your app transition through different states in their lifecycle.\n\nTo navigate transitions between stages of the activity lifecycle, the Activity class provides a core set of six callbacks: `onCreate()`, `onStart()`, `onResume()`, `onPause()`, `onStop()`, and `onDestroy()`. The system invokes each of these callbacks as an activity enters a new state."},{"question":"How can I get the context in a fragment?","answer":"You can use getActivity(), which returns the activity associated with a fragment. The activity is a context (since Activity extends Context).You can also override the onAttach method of fragment:java\npublic static class DummySectionFragment extends Fragment{\n...\n    @Override\n    public void onAttach(Activity activity) {\n        super.onAttach(activity);\n        DBHelper = new DatabaseHelper(activity);\n    }\n}"},{"question":"What is View Group? How are they different from Views?","answer":"View: View objects are the basic building blocks of User Interface(UI) elements in Android. View is a simple rectangle box which responds to the user\u2019s actions. Examples are EditText, Button, CheckBox etc. View refers to the android.view.View class, which is the base class of all UI classes.ViewGroup: ViewGroup is the invisible container. It holds View and ViewGroup. For example, LinearLayout is the ViewGroup that contains Button(View), and other Layouts also. ViewGroup is the base class for Layouts."},{"question":"Is it possible to implement the model\u2013view\u2013controller pattern in Java for Android?","answer":"In Android you don't have MVC, but you have the following:\nYou define your user interface in  various XML files by resolution, hardware, etc.\nYou define your resources in various XML files by locale, etc.\nYou extend clases like ListActivity, TabActivity and make use of the XML file by inflaters.\nYou can create as many classes as you wish for your business logic.\nA lot of Utils have been already written for you - DatabaseUtils, Html."},{"question":"What\u2019s the difference between onCreate() and onStart()?","answer":"The onCreate() method is called once during the Activity lifecycle, either when the application starts, or when the Activity has been destroyed and then recreated, for example during a configuration change.\nThe onStart() method is called whenever the Activity becomes visible to the user, typically after onCreate() or onRestart()."},{"question":"Explain the build process in Android","answer":"First step involves compiling the resources folder (\/res) using the aapt (android asset packaging tool) tool. These are compiled to a single class file called R.java. This is a class that just contains constants.\nSecond step involves the java source code being compiled to .class files by javac, and then the class files are converted to Dalvik bytecode by the \u201cdx\u201d tool, which is included in the sdk \u2018tools\u2019. The output is classes.dex.\nThe final step involves the android apkbuilder which takes all the input and builds the apk (android packaging key) file."},{"question":"What is an Intent in Android?","answer":"An Intent is basically a message that is passed between components (such as Activities, Services, Broadcast Receivers, and Content Providers).So, it is almost equivalent to parameters passed to API calls. The fundamental differences between API calls and invoking components via intents are:\nAPI calls are synchronous while intent-based invocations are asynchronous.\nAPI calls are compile-time binding while intent-based calls are run-time binding.\nTo listen for an broadcast intent (like the phone ringing, or an SMS is received), you implement a broadcast receiver, which will be passed the intent. To declare that you can handle another's app intent like \"take picture\", you declare an intent filter in your app's manifest file.If you want to fire off an intent to do something, like pop up the dialer, you fire off an intent saying you will.An Intent provides a facility for performing late runtime binding between the code in different applications."},{"question":"What is the most appropriate way to store user settings in Android application?","answer":"In general SharedPreferences are your best bet for storing preferences, so in general I'd recommend that approach for saving application and user settings.The only area of concern here is what you're saving. Passwords are always a tricky thing to store, and I'd be particularly wary of storing them as clear text. The Android architecture is such that your application's SharedPreferences are sandboxed to prevent other applications from being able to access the values so there's some security there, but physical access to a phone could potentially allow access to the values."},{"question":"In what situation should one use RecyclerView over ListView?","answer":"RecyclerView was created as a ListView improvement, so yes, you can create an attached list with ListView control, but using RecyclerView is easier as it:\nReuses cells while scrolling up\/down - this is possible with implementing View Holder in the ListView adapter, but it was an optional thing, while in the RecycleView it's the default way of writing adapter.\nDecouples list from its container - so you can put list items easily at run time in the different containers (linearLayout, gridLayout) with setting LayoutManager.\nTo conclude, RecyclerView is a more flexible control for handling \"list data\" that follows patterns of delegation of concerns and leaves for itself only one task - recycling items."},{"question":"Explain briefly all the Android application components","answer":"App components are the essential building blocks of an Android app. Each component is an entry point through which the system or a user can enter your app.There are four different types of app components:\nActivities - An activity is the entry point for interacting with the user. It represents a single screen with a user interface.\nServices - A service is a general-purpose entry point for keeping an app running in the background for all kinds of reasons. It is a component that runs in the background to perform long-running operations or to perform work for remote processes.\nBroadcast receivers - A broadcast receiver is a component that enables the system to deliver events to the app outside of a regular user flow, allowing the app to respond to system-wide broadcast announcements.\nContent providers - A content provider manages a shared set of app data that you can store in the file system, in a SQLite database, on the web, or on any other persistent storage location that your app can access."},{"question":"What is 'Context' on Android?","answer":"The documentation itself provides a rather straightforward explanation: The Context class is an \u201cInterface to global information about an application environment\".We may assume a Context is a handle to the system; it provides services like resolving resources, obtaining access to databases and preferences, and so on. An Android app has activities. Context is like a handle to the environment your application is currently running in. The activity object inherits the Context object."},{"question":"What is the Dalvik Virtual Machine?","answer":"The Dalvik Virtual Machine (DVM) is an android virtual machine optimized for mobile devices. It optimizes the virtual machine for memory, battery life and performance.The Dex compiler converts the class files into the .dex file that run on the Dalvik VM. Multiple class files are converted into one dex file."},{"question":"Tell about Constraint Layout","answer":"ConstraintLayout allows you to create large and complex layouts with a flat view hierarchy (no nested view groups). It's similar to RelativeLayout in that all views are laid out according to relationships between sibling views and the parent layout, but it's more flexible than RelativeLayout and easier to use with Android Studio's Layout Editor.Intention of ConstraintLayout is to optimize and flatten the view hierarchy of your layouts by applying some rules to each view to avoid nesting."},{"question":"What is ADB and what is it used for?","answer":"ADB is the acronym for Android Debug Bridge, which is part of the Android SDK (Software Development Kit). It uses a client-server-model (i.e. adbd, the ADB daemon, is running on the device and can be connected to), and in most cases is used via an USB connection. It is also possible to use it via WiFi (wireless adb).There's nothing you need to install on your Android device, as the ADB daemon (adbd) is already integrated into the Android OS. It is usually accessed via a command line interface from the PC, where either the full Android SDK is installed (several 30 MB download archive currently), or a massively stripped-down version for \"non-developers\", sometimes referred to as \"Mini ADB\" or \"ADB essentials\" (for Linux, this is only the adb executable; for Windows it's adb.exe plus two or three .dll files)."},{"question":"What is Dalvik?","answer":"Dalvik is a Just In Time (JIT) compiler. By the term JIT, we mean to say that whenever you run your app in your mobile device then that part of your code that is needed for execution of your app will only be compiled at that moment and rest of the code will be compiled in the future when needed. The JIT or Just In Time compiles only a part of your code and it has a smaller memory footprint and due to this, it uses very less physical space on your device."},{"question":"What types of Context do you know?","answer":"The are mainly two types of context:\n\nApplication Context: It is an instance that is the singleton and can be accessed in activity via getApplicationContext(). This context is tied to the lifecycle of an application. The application context can be used where you need a context whose lifecycle is separate from the current context or when you are passing a context beyond the scope of activity.\n\n\nActivity Context: This context is tied to the lifecycle of an activity. The activity context should be used when you are passing the context in the scope of an activity or you need the context whose lifecycle is attached to the current context."},{"question":"How do I pass data between Activities in Android application?","answer":"Details:\nI have a scenario where, after logging in through a login page, there will be a sign-out button on each activity. Can you guide me on how to keep session id available to all activities?The easiest way to do this would be to pass the session id to the signout activity in the Intent you're using to start the activity:java\nIntent intent = new Intent(getBaseContext(), SignoutActivity.class);\nintent.putExtra(\"EXTRA_SESSION_ID\", sessionId);\nstartActivity(intent);\nAccess that intent on next activity:\njava\nString sessionId = getIntent().getStringExtra(\"EXTRA_SESSION_ID\");"},{"question":"How does the OutOfMemory happens?","answer":"Out of memory error is very common error when you are developing for a application that deals with multiple images sets or large bitmaps or some Animation stuff. In Android, every application runs in a Linux Process. Each Linux Process has a Virtual Machine (Dalvik Virtual Machine) running inside it. There is a limit on the memory a process can demand and it is different for different devices and also differs for phones and tablets. When some process demands a higher memory than its limit it causes a error i.e Out of memory error.There are number of reasons why we get a Out of memory errors. Some of those are:\n\nYou are doing some operation that continuously demands a lot of memory and at some point it goes beyond the max heap memory limit of a process.\n\n\nYou are leaking some memory i.e you didn\u2019t make the previous objects you allocated eligible for Garbage Collection (GC). This is called Memory leak.\n\n\nYou are dealing with large bitmaps and loading all of them at run time. You have to deal very carefully with large bitmaps by loading the size that you need not the whole bitmap at once and then do scaling."},{"question":"What is a ContentProvider and what is it typically used for?","answer":"A content provider manages access to a central repository of data. A provider is part of an Android application, which often provides its own UI for working with the data. However, content providers are primarily intended to be used by other applications, which access the provider using a provider client object.Typically you work with content providers in one of two scenarios; \n* you may want to implement code to access an existing content provider in another application, or \n* you may want to create a new content provider in your application to share data with other applications."},{"question":"What is an AsyncTask?","answer":"AsyncTask is one of the easiest ways to implement parallelism in Android without having to deal with more complex methods like Threads. Though it offers a basic level of parallelism with the UI thread, it should not be used for longer operations (of, say, not more than 2 seconds). AsyncTask has four methods \nonPreExecute() \ndoInBackground()\nonProgressUpdate()\nonPostExecute()\nwhere doInBackground() is the most important as it is where background computations are performed."},{"question":"Why is it recommended to use only the default constructor to create a Fragment?","answer":"In short, Fragments need to have a no-args constructor for the Android system to instantiate them. Your Fragment subclasses need a public empty constructor as this is what's being called by the framework.It is used in the case when device has to restore the state of a fragment. No data will be passed and a default fragment will be created and then the state will be restored. Since the system has no way to know what you passed in your constructor or your newInstance, default constructor will be used and saved bundle should be passed via onCreate after the fragment is actually instantiated with the default constructor."},{"question":"How to persist data in an Android app?","answer":"There are basically four different ways to store data in an Android app:\nShared Preferences - to save primitive data in key-value pairs\nInternal Storage - you need to store data to the device filesystem, but you do not want any other app (even the user) to read this data\nExternal Storage -  you might want the user to view the files and data saved by your app\nSQLite database"},{"question":"Explain Android notification system","answer":"A notification is a message that Android displays outside your app's UI to provide the user with reminders, communication from other people, or other timely information from your app. Users can tap the notification to open your app or take an action directly from the notification.Notifications appear to users in different locations and formats, such as an icon in the status bar, a more detailed entry in the notification drawer, as a badge on the app's icon, and on paired wearables automatically. Beginning with Android 5.0, notifications can appear on the lock screen.Starting in Android 8.0 (API level 26), all notifications must be assigned to a channel or it will not appear. By categorizing notifications into channels, users can disable specific notification channels for your app (instead of disabling all your notifications), and users can control the visual and auditory options for each channel\u2014all from the Android system settings.[\u2b06] Angular Interview Questions"},{"question":"What is Routing Guard in Angular?","answer":"Angular\u2019s route guards are interfaces which can tell the router whether or not it should allow navigation to a requested route. They make this decision by looking for a true or false return value from a class which implements the given guard interface."},{"question":"What is a module, and what does it contain?","answer":"An Angular module is set of Angular basic building blocks like component, directives, services etc. An app can have more than one module.A module can be created using @NgModule decorator.js\n@NgModule({\n  imports:      [ BrowserModule ],\n  declarations: [ AppComponent ],\n  bootstrap:    [ AppComponent ]\n})\nexport class AppModule { }"},{"question":"What are pipes? Give me an example.","answer":"A pipe takes in data as input and transforms it to a desired output. You can chain pipes together in potentially useful combinations. You can write your own custom pipes. Angular comes with a stock of pipes such as DatePipe, UpperCasePipe, LowerCasePipe, CurrencyPipe, and PercentPipe.Consider:\n```htmlThe hero's birthday is {{ birthday | date }}```\nIn this page, you'll use pipes to transform a component's birthday property into a human-friendly date."},{"question":"What is the minimum definition of a component?","answer":"The absolute minimal configuration for a @Component in Angular is a template. Both template properties are set to optional because you have to define either template or templateUrl.When you don't define them, you will get an exception like this:\nsh\nNo template specified for component 'ComponentName'\nA selector property is not required, as you can also use your components in a route."},{"question":"What's the difference between an Angular component and module?","answer":"Components control views (html). They also communicate with other components and services to bring functionality to your app.Modules consist of one or more components. They do not control any html. Your modules declare which components can be used by components belonging to other modules, which classes will be injected by the dependency injector and which component gets bootstrapped. Modules allow you to manage your components to bring modularity to your app."},{"question":"How would you run unit test?","answer":"The Angular CLI downloads and install everything you need to test an Angular application with the Jasmine test framework.The project you create with the CLI is immediately ready to test. Just run this one CLI command:sh\nng test"},{"question":"What is a service, and when will you use it?","answer":"Angular services are singleton objects which get instantiated only once during the lifetime of an application. They contain methods that maintain data throughout the life of an application, i.e. data does not get refreshed and is available all the time. The main objective of a service is to organize and share business logic, models, or data and functions with different components of an Angular application.The separation of concerns is the main reason why Angular services came into existence. An Angular service is a stateless object and provides some very useful functions."},{"question":"What is interpolation?","answer":"Interpolation is a special syntax that Angular converts into property binding. It\u2019s a convenient alternative to property binding. It is represented by double curly braces({{}}). The text between the braces is often the name of a component property. Angular replaces that name with the string value of the corresponding component property.\nLet's take an example,\nhtml\n    <h3>\n      {{title}}\n      <img src=\"{{url}}\" style=\"height:30px\">\n    <\/h3>\nIn the example above, Angular evaluates the title and url properties and fills in the blanks, first displaying a bold application title and then a URL."},{"question":"What is a bootstrapping module?","answer":"Every application has at least one Angular module, the root module that you bootstrap to launch the application is called as bootstrapping module. It is commonly known as AppModule. The default structure of AppModule generated by AngularCLI would be as follows,\n```javascript\n    \/ JavaScript imports \/\n    import { BrowserModule } from '@angular\/platform-browser';\n    import { NgModule } from '@angular\/core';\n    import { FormsModule } from '@angular\/forms';\n    import { HttpClientModule } from '@angular\/common\/http';import { AppComponent } from '.\/app.component';\n\n\/* the AppModule class with the @NgModule decorator *\/\n@NgModule({\n  declarations: [\n    AppComponent\n  ],\n  imports: [\n    BrowserModule,\n    FormsModule,\n    HttpClientModule\n  ],\n  providers: [],\n  bootstrap: [AppComponent]\n})\nexport class AppModule { }\n```"},{"question":"What is the equivalent of ngShow and ngHide in Angular?","answer":"Just bind to the hidden property"},{"question":"What is an observable?","answer":"An Observable is a unique Object similar to a Promise that can help manage async code. Observables are not part of the JavaScript language so we need to rely on a popular Observable library called RxJS.\n    The observables are created using new keyword. Let see the simple example of observable,\n```javascript\n    import { Observable } from 'rxjs';const observable = new Observable(observer => {\n  setTimeout(() => {\n    observer.next('Hello from a Observable!');\n  }, 2000);\n});`\n```"},{"question":"What is a component? Why would you use it?","answer":"Components are the most basic building block of an UI in an Angular application. An Angular application is a tree of Angular components. Angular components are a subset of directives. Unlike directives, components always have a template and only one component can be instantiated per an element in a template.A component must belong to an NgModule in order for it to be usable by another component or application. To specify that a component is a member of an NgModule, you should list it in the declarations field of that NgModule.js\n@Component({selector: 'greet', template: 'Hello {{name}}!'})\nclass Greet {\n  name: string = 'World';\n}"},{"question":"What is an observer?","answer":"Observer is an interface for a consumer of push-based notifications delivered by an Observable. It has below structure,\njavascript\n    interface Observer<T> {\n      closed?: boolean;\n      next: (value: T) => void;\n      error: (err: any) => void;\n      complete: () => void;\n    }\nA handler that implements the Observer interface for receiving observable notifications will be passed as a parameter for observable as below,\njavascript\n    myObservable.subscribe(myObserver);\nNote: If you don't supply a handler for a notification type, the observer ignores notifications of that type."},{"question":"What is the purpose of base href tag?","answer":"The routing application should add  element to the index.html as the first child in the  tag inorder to indicate how to compose navigation URLs. If app folder is the application root then you can set the href value as below\nhtml\n    <base href=\"\/\">"},{"question":"You have an HTML response I want to display. How do I do that?","answer":"The correct syntax is the following:\n```html``\nWorking in5.2.6`"},{"question":"What is the difference between Structural and Attribute directives in Angular?","answer":"Structural directives are used to alter the DOM layout by removing and adding DOM elements. It is far better in changing the structure of the view. Examples of Structural directives are NgFor and Nglf.\n\n\nAttribute Directives These are being used as characteristics of elements. For example, a directive such as built-in NgStyle in the template Syntax guide is an attribute directive."},{"question":"How can I select an element in a component template?","answer":"You can get a handle to the DOM element via ElementRef by injecting it into your component's constructor:js\nconstructor(myElement: ElementRef) { ... }"},{"question":"What is the equivalent of \"ngShow\" and \"ngHide\" in Angular?","answer":"Just bind to the hidden property:js\n[hidden]=\"!myVar\""},{"question":"What is the difference between *ngIf vs [hidden]?","answer":"*ngIf effectively removes its content from the DOM while [hidden] modifies the display property and only instructs the browser to not show the content but the DOM still contains it."},{"question":"What are the differences between AngularJS (angular 1.x) and Angular (Angular 2.x and beyond)?","answer":"Angular and AngularJS is basically a different framework with the same name.Angular is more ready for the current state of web standards and the future state of the web (ES6\\7, immutiablity, components, shadow DOM, service workers, mobile compatibilty, modules, typescript and so on and so on... )Angular killed many main features in AngularJS like - controllers, $scope, directives (replaced with @component annotations), the module definition, and much more, even simple things like ng-repeat has not left the same as it was.Also: \n1. They added an angular cli.\n2. Your angular code is written in ES6 Typescript and it compiles at runtime to Javascript in the browser.\n3. You bind to your HTML similarly like how you would if in an Angular 1 directive. So variable like $scope and $rootScope have been deprecated."},{"question":"What are some differences between Angular 2 and 4?","answer":"Just to name a few:\n* Improvements in AOT, \n* allowing the \"else\" clause in ngIf, \n* support for TypeScript 2.1\n* breaking out the animations package"},{"question":"What is the difference between \"@Component\" and \"@Directive\" in Angular?","answer":"Directives add behaviour to an existing DOM element or an existing component instance.\nA component, rather than adding\/modifying behaviour, actually creates its own view (hierarchy of DOM elements) with attached behaviour.\nWrite a component when you want to create a reusable set of DOM elements of UI with custom behaviour. Write a directive when you want to write reusable behaviour to supplement existing DOM elements."},{"question":"How would you protect a component being activated through the router?","answer":"The Angular router ships with a feature called guards. These provide us with ways to control the flow of our application. We can stop a user from visitng certain routes, stop a user from leaving routes, and more. The overall process for protecting Angular routes:\nCreate a guard service: ng g guard auth\nCreate canActivate() or canActivateChild() methods\nUse the guard when defining routes\njs\n\/\/ import the newly created AuthGuard\nconst routes: Routes = [\n  {\n    path: 'account',\n    canActivate: [AuthGuard]\n  }\n];Some other available guards:\nCanActivate: Check if a user has access\nCanActivateChild: Check if a user has access to any of the child routes\nCanDeactivate: Can a user leave a page?

In this way any change in model will update the view and vice versa without any DOM\nmanipulation or event handling.\nIt encapsulates the behavior of your application in controllers which are instantiated with the help of\ndependency injection.\nIt supports services that can be injected into your controllers to use some utility code to fullfil your need.\nFor example, it provides $http service to communicate with REST service.\nIt supports dependency injection which helps you to test your angular app code very easily.\nAlso, AngularJS is mature community to help you. It has widely support over the internet."},{"question":"What is the difference between \"ng-show\"\/\"ng-hide\" and \"ng-if\" directives?","answer":"ng-show\/ng-hide will always insert the DOM element, but will display\/hide it based on the condition. ng-if will not insert the DOM element until the condition is not fulfilled.ng-if is better when we needed the DOM to be loaded conditionally, as it will help load page bit faster compared to ng-show\/ng-hide.We only need to keep in mind what the difference between these directives is, so deciding which one to use totally depends on the task requirements."},{"question":"Does AngularJS has dependency on jQuery?","answer":"AngularJS has no dependency on jQuery library. But it can be used with jQuery library."},{"question":"How do you hide an HTML element via a button click in AngularJS?","answer":"This can be done by using the ng-hide directive in conjunction with a controller to hide an HTML element on button click.```html\nHide element\nHello World!\n```js\nfunction MyCtrl($scope) {\n    $scope.isHide = false;\n    $scope.hide = function () {\n        $scope.isHide = true;\n    };\n}"},{"question":"What is a singleton pattern and where we can find it in AngularJS?","answer":"Is a great pattern that restricts the use of a class more than once. We can find singleton pattern in angular in dependency injection and in the services.In a sense, if the you do 2 times new Object() without this pattern, the you will be alocating 2 pieces of memory for the same object. With singleton pattern, if the object exists, it'll be reused."},{"question":"What are the AngularJS features?","answer":"The features of AngularJS are listed below:\nModules\nDirectives\nTemplates\nScope\nExpressions\nData Binding\nMVC (Model, View & Controller)\nValidations\nFilters\nServices\nRouting\nDependency Injection\nTesting"},{"question":"When dependent modules of a module are loaded?","answer":"A module might have dependencies on other modules. The dependent modules are loaded by angular\nbefore the requiring module is loaded.In other words the configuration blocks of the dependent modules execute before the configuration blocks of the requiring module. The same is true for the run blocks. Each module can only be loaded once, even if multiple other modules require it."},{"question":"What is Angular\u2019s prefixes $ and $$?","answer":"To prevent accidental name collisions with your code, Angular prefixes names of public objects with $ and names of private objects with $$. So, do not use the $ or $$ prefix in your code."},{"question":"What are Filters in AngularJS?","answer":"Filters are used to format data before displaying it to the user. They can be used in view templates, controllers, services and directives. There are some built-in filters provided by AngularJS like as Currency, Date, Number, OrderBy, Lowercase, Uppercase etc. You can also create your own filters.Filter Syntax:{{ expression | filter}}"},{"question":"What are Directives in AngularJS?","answer":"AngularJS directives are a combination of AngularJS template markups (HTML attributes or elements, or CSS classes) and supporting JavaScript code. The JavaScript directive code defines the template data and behaviors of the HTML elements.AngularJS directives are used to extend the HTML vocabulary i.e. they decorate html elements with new behaviors and help to manipulate html elements attributes in interesting way.There are some built-in directives provided by AngularJS like as ng-app, ng-controller, ng-repeat, ng-model etc."},{"question":"What are Directives?","answer":"Directives are markers on a DOM element (such as an attribute, element name, comment or CSS class) that tell AngularJS\u2019s HTML compiler ($compile) to attach a specified behavior to that DOM element (e.g. via event listeners), or even to transform the DOM element and its children. Angular comes with a set of these directives built-in, like ngBind, ngModel, and ngClass. Much like you create controllers and services, you can create your own directives for Angular to use. When Angular bootstraps your application, the HTML compiler traverses the DOM matching directives against the DOM elements."},{"question":"Explain what is a \"$scope\" in AngularJS","answer":"Scope is an object that refers to the application model. It is an execution context for expressions. Scopes are arranged in hierarchical structure which mimic the DOM structure of the application. Scopes can watch expressions and propagate events. Scopes are objects that refer to the model. They act as glue between controller and view."},{"question":"What directive would you use to hide elements from the HTML DOM by removing them from that DOM not changing their styling?","answer":"The ngIf Directive, when applied to an element, will remove that element from the DOM if it\u2019s condition is false."},{"question":"What is the difference between one-way binding and two-way binding?","answer":"One way binding implies that the scope variable in the html will be set to the first value its model is bound to (i.e. assigned to)  \nTwo way binding implies that the scope variable will change it\u2019s value everytime its model is assigned to a different value"},{"question":"What is auto bootstrap process in AngularJS?","answer":"Angular initializes automatically upon DOMContentLoaded event or when the angular.js script is downloaded to the browser and the document.readyState is set to complete. At this point AngularJS looks for the ng-app directive which is the root of angular app compilation and tells about AngularJS part within DOM. When the ng-app directive is found then Angular will:\nLoad the module associated with the directive.\nCreate the application injector.\nCompile the DOM starting from the ng-app root element.\nThis process is called auto-bootstrapping.\n```html\n\n Hello {{msg}}!\n\n\n\n\n```"},{"question":"How would you specify that a scope variable should have one-time binding only?","answer":"By using \u201c::\u201d in front of it."},{"question":"What is scope in AngularJS?","answer":"Scope is a JavaScript object that refers to the application model. It acts as a context for evaluating angular expressions. Basically, it acts as glue between controller and view.Scopes are hierarchical in nature and follow the DOM structure of your AngularJS app. AngularJS has two scope objects: $rootScope and $scope."},{"question":"How do you disable a button depending on a checkbox\u2019s state?","answer":"We can use the ng-disabled directive and bind its condition to the checkbox\u2019s state.```html\n\nDisable Button\n    \nSelect me\n```"},{"question":"What is scope hierarchy?","answer":"The $scope object used by views in AngularJS are organized into a hierarchy. There is a root scope, and the $rootScope can has one or more child scopes. Each controller has its own $scope (which is a child of the $rootScope), so whatever variables you create on $scope within controller, these variables are accessible by the view based on this controller.For example, suppose you have two controllers: ParentController and ChildController as given below:\n```html\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nParent Controller\n\nManager Name\n{{managerName}}\n\n\nCompany Name\n{{companyName}}\n\n\n\n\nChild Controller\n\nTeam Lead Name\n{{ teamLeadName }}\n\n\nReporting To\n{{managerName}}\n\n\nCompany Name\n{{companyName}}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n```"},{"question":"How do you share data between controllers?","answer":"Create an AngularJS service that will hold the data and inject it inside of the controllers.Using a service is the cleanest, fastest and easiest way to test. However, there are couple of other ways to implement data sharing between controllers, like:\u2013 Using events\n\u2013 Using $parent, nextSibling, controllerAs, etc. to directly access the controllers\n\u2013 Using the $rootScope to add the data on (not a good practice)The methods above are all correct, but are not the most efficient and easy to test."},{"question":"What are the basic steps to unit test an AngularJS filter?","answer":"Inject the module that contains the filter.\nProvide any mocks that the filter relies on.\nGet an instance of the filter using $filter('yourFilterName').\nAssert your expectations."},{"question":"What are the advantage of AngularJS?","answer":"There are following advantages of AngularJS:\nData Binding - AngularJS provides a powerful data binding mechanism to bind data to HTML elements by using scope.\nCustomize & Extensible - AngularJS is customized and extensible as per you requirement.

On the internet over hundreds of GB of data is generated only by online activity. Here, online activity implies web activity, blogs, text, video\/audio files, images, email, social network activity, and so on. Big data can be referred to data created from all these activities. Data generated online is mostly in unstructured form. Big data will also include transactions data in the database, system log files, along with data generated from smart devices such as sensors, IoT, RFID tags, and so on in addition to online activities.Big data needs specialized systems and software tools to process all unstructured data. In fact, according to some industry estimates almost 85% of data generated on the internet is unstructured. Usually, relational databases have a structured format and the database is centralized. Hence, with RDBMS processing can be quickly done using a query language such as SQL. On the other hand, big data is very large and is distributed across the internet and hence processing big data will need distributed systems and tools to extract information from them. Big data needs specialized tools such as Hadoop, Hive, or others along with high-performance hardware and networks to process them."},{"question":"What are the characteristics of big data?","answer":"Big data has three main characteristics: Volume, Variety, and Velocity.\nVolume characteristic refers to the size of data. Estimates show that over 3 million GB of data is generated every day. Processing this volume of data is not possible in a normal personal computer or in a client-server network in an office environment with limited compute bandwidth and storage capacities. However, cloud services provide solutions to handle big data volumes and process them efficiently using distributed computing architectures.Variety characteristic refers to the format of big data \u2013 structured or unstructured. Traditional RDBMS fits into the structured format. An example of unstructured data format is, a video file format, image files, plain text format, from web document or standard MS Word documents, all have unique formats, and so on. Also to note, RDBMS does not have the capacity to handle unstructured data formats. Further, all this unstructured data must be grouped and consolidated which creates the need for specialized tools and systems. In addition new, data is added each day, or each minute and data grows continuously. Hence big data is more synonymous with variety.The velocity characteristic refers to the speed at which data is created and the efficiency required to process all the data. For example, Facebook is accessed by over 1.6 billion users in a month. Likewise, there are other social network sites, YouTube, Google services, etc. Such data streams must be processed using queries in real time and must be stored without data loss. Thus, velocity characteristic is important in big data processing.\nIn addition, other characteristics include veracity and value. Veracity will determine the dependability and reliability of data and value is the value derived by organizations from big data processing."},{"question":"Why is big data important for organizations?","answer":"This is the basic Big Data interview question asked in an interview. Big data is important because by processing big data, organizations can obtain insight information related to:\nCost reduction\nImprovements in products or services\nTo understand customer behaviour and markets\nEffective decision making\nTo become more competitive"},{"question":"Name some tools or systems used in big data processing?","answer":"Big data processing and analysis can be done using:\n * Hadoop\n * Hive\n * Pig\n * Mahout\n * Flume"},{"question":"How can big data support organizations?","answer":"Big data has the potential to support organizations in many ways. Information extracted from big data can be used in:\n * Better coordination with customers and stakeholders and to resolve problems\n * Improve reporting and analysis for product or service improvements\n * Customize products and services to selected markets\n * Ensure better information sharing\n * Support in management decisions\n * Identify new opportunities, product ideas, and new markets\n * Gather data from multiple sources and archive them for future reference\n * Maintain databases, systems\n * Determine performance metrics\n * Understand interdependencies between business functions\n * Evaluate organizational performance"},{"question":"Explain how big data can be used to increase business value?","answer":"While understanding the need for analyzing big data, such analysis will help businesses to identify their position in markets, and help businesses to differentiate themselves from their competitors. For example, from the results of big data analysis, organizations can understand the need for customized products or can understand potential markets towards increasing revenue and value. Analyzing big data will involve grouping data from various sources to understand trends and information related to business. When big data analysis is done in a planned manner by gathering data from the right sources, organizations can easily generate business value and revenue by almost 5% to 20%. Some examples of such organizations are Amazon, Linkedin, WalMart, and many others."},{"question":"What is big data solution implementation?","answer":"Big data solutions are implemented at a small scale first, based on a concept as appropriate for the business.

They are:Data ingestion: This step will define the approach to extract and consolidate data from multiple sources. For example, data sources can be social network feeds, CRM, RDBMS, etc. The data extracted from different sources is stored in a Hadoop distributed file system (HDFS).Data storage: This is the second step, the extracted data is stored. This storage can be in HDFS or HBase (NoSQL database).Process the data: This is the last step. The data stored must be processed. Processing is done using tools such as Spark, Pig, MapReduce, and others.[\u2b06] Blockchain Interview Questions"},{"question":"What is blockchain?","answer":"Blockchain is a secure distributed ledger (data structure or database) that maintains a continuously growing list of ordered records, called \u201cblocks\u201d,  that are linked using cryptography. Each block contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block, a timestamp, and transaction data.By design, a blockchain is resistant to modification of the data. It is \"an open, distributed ledger that can record transactions between two parties efficiently and in a verifiable and permanent way\".Once recorded, the data in any given block cannot be altered retroactively without alteration of all subsequent blocks, which requires consensus of the network majority."},{"question":"Explain the common structure of blockchains","answer":"Blockchains are composed of three core parts:\n* Block: A list of transactions recorded into a ledger over a given period. The size, period, and triggering event for blocks is different for every blockchain.\n* Chain: A hash that links one block to another, mathematically \u201cchaining\u201d them together. \n* Network: The network is composed of \u201cfull nodes.\u201d Think of them as the computer running an algorithm that is securing the network. Each node contains a complete record of all the transactions that were ever recorded in that blockchain."},{"question":"What is the blockchain data structure?","answer":"Basically the blockchain data structure is explained as a back-linked record of blocks of transactions, which is ordered. It can be saved as a file or in a plain database. Each block can be recognized by a hash, created utilizing the SHA256 cryptographic hash algorithm on the header of the block. Each block mentions a former block, also identified as the parent block, in the \u201cprevious block hash\u201d field, in the block header."},{"question":"What is the Genesis Block?","answer":"The first block in any blockchain is termed the genesis block. If you start at any block and follow the chain backwards chronologically, you will arrive at the genesis block. The genesis block is statically encoded within the client software, that it cannot be changed. Every node can identify the genesis block\u2019s hash and structure, the fixed time of creation, and the single transactions within. Thus every node has a secure \u201croot\u201d from which is possible to build a trusted blockchain on."},{"question":"What is blockchain transaction?","answer":"Transactions are the things that give a blockchain purpose. They are the smallest building blocks of a blockchain system. Transactions generally consist of:\n* a recipient address, \n* a sender address, \n* and a value. This is not too different from a standard transaction that you would find on a credit card statement.A transaction changes the state of the agreed-correct blockchain. A blockchain is a shared, decentralized, distributed state machine. This means that all nodes (users of the blockchain system) independently hold their own copy of the blockchain, and the current known \"state\" is calculated by processing each transaction in order as it appears in the blockchain."},{"question":"What is the purpose of a blockchain node?","answer":"A blockchain exists out of blocks of data. These blocks of data are stored on nodes (compare it to small servers). Nodes can be any kind of device (mostly computers, laptops or even bigger servers). Nodes form the infrastructure of a blockchain. All nodes on a blockchain are connected to each other and they constantly exchange the latest blockchain data with each other so all nodes stay up to date. They store, spread and preserve the blockchain data, so theoretically a blockchain exists on nodes. A full node is basically a device (like a computer) that contains a full copy of the transaction history of the blockchain."},{"question":"Why does Blockchain need coins or tokens?","answer":"Tokens\/Coins are used as a medium of exchange between the states. They are digital assets built in to perform a specific function within a blockchain.When someone does a transaction, there is a change of state, and coins are moved from one address to another address. Apart from that, transactions contain some additional data; this data can be mutated through the change of state. For this reason, blockchains need coins or tokens to incentivize the participants to join their networks."},{"question":"What is proof-of-work?","answer":"A proof of work is a piece of data which is difficult (costly, time-consuming) to produce but easy for others to verify and which satisfies certain requirements. Producing a proof of work can be a random process with low probability so that a lot of trial and error is required on average before a valid proof of work is generated. Difficulty is a measure of how difficult it is to find a hash below a given target."},{"question":"What is deterministic behavior?","answer":"If A + B = C, then no matter what the circumstances, A+B will always be equal to C. That is called deterministic behavior.Hash functions are deterministic, meaning A\u2019s hash will always be H(A).[\u2b06] Bootstrap Interview Questions"},{"question":"Explain Bootstrap?","answer":"Bootstrap is a platform for web development that is based on front-end framework\nand creates exceptional responsive designs.

The default font is changed to `Helvetica` and `Arial` with `sans serif` fallback. \n\nAll these styles are applied to the `` and all paragraphs, with the addition that `` (paragraphs) receive a bottom margin of half their computed line-height, which is `10px` by default.\n\n\n#### What is the procedure to create Nav elements in Bootstrap? \nThere are several styling navigation elements available on bootstrap and every\nstyle uses the same function i.e. class `.nav`. In order to create tabs or a\ntabular navigation, you can begin with a simple or rather basic unordered list\nusing the function class `.nav`. To add the tabs the function class `.nav-tabs` can\nbe used.\n\n\n####  What are Glyphicons? \nGlyphicons are icon fonts which you can use in your web projects. Glyphicons\nHalflings are not free and require licensing, however their creator has made\nthem available for Bootstrap projects free of cost.\n\nTo use the icons, simply use the following code just about anywhere in your\ncode.

C# provides the rapid application development found in Visual Basic with the power of C++. Its syntax is similar to C++ syntax and meets 100% of the requirements of OOPs like the following: \n* Abstraction\n* Encapsulation\n* Polymorphism\n* Inheritance\n\n\n#### What is the difference between \"continue\" and \"break\" statements in C#? \n* using **break** statement, you can jump out of a loop\n* using **continue** statement, you can jump over one iteration and then resume your loop execution\n\n\n#### What are property Accessors? \nThe _get_ and _set_ portions or blocks of a property are called accessors. These are useful to restrict the accessibility of a property, the set accessor specifies that we can assign a value to a private field in a property and without the set accessor property it is like a read-only field. By the get accessor we can access the value of the private field, in other words it returns a single value. A Get accessor specifies that we can access the value of a field publically.\n\n\n#### What is an Object? \nAccording to MSDN, \"_a class or struct definition is like a blueprint that specifies what the type can do. An object is basically a block of memory that has been allocated and configured according to the blueprint. A program may create many objects of the same class. Objects are also called instances, and they can be stored in either a named variable or in an array or collection. Client code is the code that uses these variables to call the methods and access the public properties of the object. In an object-oriented language such as C#, a typical program consists of multiple objects interacting dynamically\"._\n\nObjects helps us to access the member of a class or struct either they can be fields, methods or properties, by using the dot. \n\n\n#### What is enum in C#? \nAn **enum** is a value type with a set of related named constants often referred to as an enumerator list. The enum keyword is used to declare an enumeration. It is a primitive data type, which is user defined. An enum is used to create numeric constants in .NET framework. All the members of enum are of enum type. Their must be a numeric value for each enum type.\n\n**Some points about enum**\n\n* Enums are enumerated data type in C#.  \n* Enums are strongly typed constant. They are strongly typed, i.e. an enum of one type may not be implicitly assigned to an enum of another type even though the underlying value of their members are the same.  \n* Enumerations (enums) make your code much more readable and understandable.  \n* Enum values are fixed. Enum can be displayed as a string and processed as an integer.  \n* The default type is int, and the approved types are byte, sbyte, short, ushort, uint, long, and ulong.  \n* Every enum type automatically derives from System.Enum and thus we can use System.Enum methods on enums.  \n* Enums are value types and are created on the stack and not on the heap.\n\n\n#### How is Exception Handling implemented in C#? \nException handling is done using four keywords in C#:\n\n*   **try** \u2013 Contains a block of code for which an exception will be checked.\n*   **catch** \u2013 It is a program that catches an exception with the help of exception handler.\n*   **finally** \u2013 It is a block of code written to execute regardless whether an exception is caught or not.\n*   **Throw** \u2013 Throws an exception when a problem occurs.\n\n\n#### Can \"this\" be used within a static method? \nWe can't use _this_ in static method because keyword _this_ returns a reference to the current instance of the class containing it. Static methods (or any static member) do not belong to a particular instance. They exist without creating an instance of the class and call with the name of a class not by instance so we can't use this keyword in the body of static Methods, but in case of Extension Methods we can use it as the functions parameters.\n\n\n#### Define Property in C#? \n**Properties** are members that provide a flexible mechanism to read, write or compute the values of private fields, in other words by the property we can access private fields. In other words we can say that a property is a return type function\/method with one parameter or without a parameter. These are always public data members. It uses methods to access and assign values to private fields called accessors.\n\n\n#### What is Boxing and Unboxing? \nBoxing and Unboxing both are used for type conversion but have some difference:\n\n* **Boxing** - Boxing is the process of converting a value type data type to the object or to any interface data type which is implemented by this value type. When the CLR boxes a value means when CLR is converting a value type to Object Type, it wraps the value inside a System.Object and stores it on the heap area in application domain.\n\n* **Unboxing** - Unboxing is also a process which is used to extract the value type from the object or any implemented interface type. Boxing may be done implicitly, but unboxing have to be explicit by code. \n\nThe concept of boxing and unboxing underlines the C# unified view of the type system in which a value of any type can be treated as an object.\n\n\n#### What is the difference between string and StringBuilder in c#? \n**String**\n* It's an immutable object that hold string value.\n* Performance wise string is slow because its' create a new instance to override or change the previous value.\n* String belongs to System namespace.\n\n**StringBuilder**\n* StringBuilder is a mutable object.  \n* Performance wise StringBuilder is very fast because it will use same instance of StringBuilder object to perform any operation like insert value in existing string.  \n* StringBuilder belongs to System.Text.Stringbuilder namespace.\n\n\n#### What are partial classes? \nA **partial** class is only use to splits the definition of a class in two or more classes in a same source code file or more than one source files. You can create a class definition in multiple files but it will be compiled as one class at run time and also when you'll create an instance of this class so you can access all the methods from all source file with a same object. Partial classes can be create in the same namespace it's doesn't allowed to create a partial class in different namespace. \n\n\n#### Filter out the first 3 even numbers from the list using LINQ \n```csharp\nvar evenNumbers = List\n   .Where(x => x % 2 ==0)\n   .Take(3)\n```\n\n\n#### Why to use \u201cfinally\u201d block in C#? \n**Finally** block will be executed irrespective of exception. So while executing the code in try block when exception is occurred, control is returned to catch block and at last `finally` block will be executed. So closing connection to database \/ releasing the file handlers can be kept in `finally` block.\n\n\n#### What are nullable types in C#? \nC# provides a special data types, the **nullable types**, to which you can assign normal range of values as well as null values.\n\nFor example, you can store any value from -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647 or null in a `Nullable` variable. Similarly, you can assign true, false, or null in a `Nullable` variable.\n\n\n#### What are generics in C#? \n**Generics** allow you to delay the specification of the data type of programming elements in a class or a method, until it is actually used in the program. In other words, generics allow you to write a class or method that can work with any data type.\n\n\n#### What is Managed or Unmanaged Code? \n* **Managed Code**  - The code, which is developed in .NET framework is known as managed code. This code is directly executed by CLR with the help of managed code execution. Any language that is written in .NET Framework is managed code.\n* **Unmanaged Code** - The code, which is developed outside .NET framework is known as unmanaged code. Applications that do not run under the control of the CLR are said to be unmanaged, and certain languages such as C++ can be used to write such applications, which, for example, access low - level functions of the operating system. Background compatibility with the code of VB, ASP and COM are examples of unmanaged code.\n\n\n\n#### What are reference types in C#? \nThe **reference types** do not contain the actual data stored in a variable, but they contain a reference to the variables.\n\nIn other words, they refer to a memory location. Using multiple variables, the reference types can refer to a memory location. If the data in the memory location is changed by one of the variables, the other variable automatically reflects this change in value. Example of built-in reference types are: object, dynamic, and string.\n\n\n#### What you understand by Value types and Reference types in C#.Net? \nIn C# data types can be of two types: **Value Types** and **Reference Types**. Value type variables contain their object (or data) directly. If we copy one value type variable to another then we are actually making a copy of the object for the second variable. Value Type member will located into Stack and reference member will located in Heap always.  \n\n\n#### What is namespace in C#? \nA **namespace** is designed for providing a way to keep one set of names separate from another. The class names declared in one namespace does not conflict with the same class names declared in another.\n\n\n#### What is Serialization? \n**Serialization** means saving the state of your object to secondary memory, such as a file.\n\n1.  Binary serialization (Save your object data into binary format).  \n2.  Soap Serialization (Save your object data into binary format; mainly used in network related communication).  \n3.  XmlSerialization (Save your object data into an XML file).\n\n\n#### In how many ways you can pass parameters to a method? \nThere are three ways that parameters can be passed to a method:\n\n*   **Value parameters** \u2212 This method copies the actual value of an argument into the formal parameter of the function. In this case, changes made to the parameter inside the function have no effect on the argument.\n*   **Reference parameters** \u2212 This method copies the reference to the memory location of an argument into the formal parameter. This means that changes made to the parameter affect the argument.\n*   **Output parameters** \u2212 This method helps in returning more than one value.\n\n\n#### Can you return multiple values from a function in C#? \nYes! Using output parameters. A return statement can be used for returning only one value from a function. However, using output parameters, you can return two values from a function.\n\n\n#### What is LINQ in C#? \n**LINQ** stands for Language Integrated Query. LINQ has a great power of querying on any source of data. The data source could be collections of objects, database or XML files. We can easily retrieve data from any object that implements the `IEnumerable` interface. \n\n\n#### Can multiple catch blocks be executed? \nNo, Multiple catch blocks can't be executed. Once the proper catch code executed, the control is transferred to the finally block and then the code that follows the finally block gets executed.\n\n\n#### What is an Abstract Class? \nAn **Abstract class** is a class which is denoted by abstract keyword and can be used only as a Base class. An Abstract class should always be inherited. An instance of the class itself cannot be created. If we do not want any program to create an object of a class, then such classes can be made abstract.\n\nAny method in the abstract class does not have implementations in the same class. But they must be implemented in the child class.\n\n\n#### What are Custom Exceptions? \nSometimes there are some errors that need to be handeled as per user requirements. Custom exceptions are used for them and are used defined exceptions.\n\n\n#### What is the difference between a struct and a class in C#? \nClass and struct both are the user defined data type but have some major difference:  \n**  \nStruct**\n\n* The struct is value type in C# and it inherits from System.Value Type.\n* Struct is usually used for smaller amounts of data.\n* Struct can't be inherited to other type.\n* A structure can't be abstract.\n* No need to create object by new keyword.\n* Do not have permission to create any default constructor.\n\n**Class**\n\n* The class is reference type in C# and it inherits from the System.Object Type.\n* Classes are usually used for large amounts of data.\n* Classes can be inherited to other class.\n* A class can be abstract type.\n* We can't use an object of a class with using new keyword.\n* We can create a default constructor.\n\n\n#### Why can't you specify the accessibility modifier for methods inside the interface? \nIn an interface, we have virtual methods that do not have method definition. All the methods are there to be overridden in the derived class. That's why they all are public.\n\n\n#### What are the different types of classes in C#? \nThe different types of class in C# are:\n\n*   **Partial class** \u2013 Allows its members to be divided or shared with multiple .cs files. It is denoted by the keyword _Partial._\n*   **Sealed class** \u2013 It is a class which cannot be inherited. To access the members of a sealed class, we need to create the object of the class.\u00a0 It is denoted by the keyword _Sealed_.\n*   **Abstract class** \u2013 It is a class whose object cannot be instantiated. The class can only be inherited. It should contain at least one method.\u00a0 It is denoted by the keyword _abstract._\n*   **Static class** \u2013 It is a class which does not allow inheritance. The members of the class are also static.\u00a0 It is denoted by the keyword _static_. This keyword tells the compiler to check for any accidental instances of the static class.\n\n\n#### What are dynamic type variables in C#? \nYou can store any type of value in the dynamic data type variable. Type checking for these types of variables takes place at run-time.\n\n\n## [[\u2b06]](#toc) CSS Interview Questions\n#### Explain the three main ways to apply CSS styles to a web page \nUsing the inline style attribute on an element\n```html\n\n\n\n```\nUsing a `\n\n```\nLoading an external CSS file using the `` tag\n```html\n\nCSS Refresher\n\n\n```\n\n\n#### What is CSS? \n**CSS** stands for **Cascading Style Sheets**. CSS is used to define styles for your web pages, including the design, layout and variations in display for different devices and screen sizes.\n\nCSS was intended to allow web professionals to separate the content and structure of a website's code from the visual design.\n\n\n#### How to use variables in Sass? \nThink of variables as a way to store information that you want to reuse throughout your stylesheet. You can store things like colors, font stacks, or any CSS value you think you'll want to reuse. Sass uses the `$` symbol to make something a variable.\n\n```css\n$font-stack:    Helvetica, sans-serif;\n$primary-color: #333;\n\nbody {\n  font: 100% $font-stack;\n  color: $primary-color;\n}\n```\n\n\n\n#### What is variable interpolation in Sass? Provide some examples.  \n If you want to use variables inside a string, you will have to use a process called **variable interpolation**. To use it you will have to wrap your variables in `#{}`. \n\nConsider:\n```css\n$name: 'Gajendar';\n$author: 'Author : $name'; \/\/ 'Author : $name'\n\n$author: 'Author : #{$name}';\n\/\/ 'Author : Gajendar'\n```\n\nThe interpolation method could be useful in situations where the value of a variable is determined by some conditional statements. \n\n\n#### What is a CSS rule? \nWeb browsers apply **CSS rules** to a document to affect how they are displayed. A CSS rule is formed from:\n\n* A **set of properties**, which have values set to update how the HTML content is displayed,\n* A **selector**, which selects the element(s) you want to apply the updated property values to.\n\nA set of CSS rules contained within a stylesheet determines how a webpage should look. \n\n\n#### What is DOM (Document Object Model) and how is it linked to CSS? \nThe *Document Object Model (DOM)* is a cross-platform and language-independent *application programming interface* that treats an HTML, XHTML, or XML document as a tree structure wherein each node is an object representing a part of the document. \n\nWith the Document Object Model, programmers can create and build documents, navigate their structure, and add, modify, or delete elements and content. The DOM specifies interfaces which may be used to manage XML or HTML documents. \n\nWhen a browser displays a document, it must combine the document's content with its style information. The browser converts HTML and CSS into the DOM (Document Object Model). The DOM represents the document in the computer's memory. It combines the document's content with its style.\n\n\n#### Have you played around with the new CSS Flexbox or Grid specs? \nYes. Flexbox is mainly meant for 1-dimensional layouts while Grid is meant for 2-dimensional layouts.\n\nFlexbox solves many common problems in CSS, such as vertical centering of elements within a container, sticky footer, etc. Bootstrap and Bulma are based on Flexbox, and it is probably the recommended way to create layouts these days. Have tried Flexbox before but ran into some browser incompatibility issues (Safari) in using `flex-grow`, and I had to rewrite my code using `inline-blocks` and math to calculate the widths in percentages, it wasn't a nice experience.\n\nGrid is by far the most intuitive approach for creating grid-based layouts (it better be!) but browser support is not wide at the moment.\n\n\n#### What is Sass? \n**Sass** or **Syntactically Awesome StyleSheets** is a *CSS* preprocessor that adds power and elegance to the basic language. It allows you to use variables, nested rules, mixins, inline imports, and more, all with a fully CSS-compatible syntax. Sass helps keep large stylesheets well-organized, and get small stylesheets up and running quickly.\n\nA *CSS preprocessor* is a scripting language that extends CSS by allowing developers to write code in one language and then compile it into CSS. \n\n\n\n#### List out the key features for Sass? \nKey features for Sass include\n\n* Full CSS3-compatible\n* Language extensions such as nesting, variables, and mixins\n* Many useful functions for manipulating colors and other values\n* Advanced features like control directives for libraries\n* Well-formatted, customizable output\n\n\n#### What existing CSS frameworks have you used locally, or in production? How would you change\/improve them? \n* **Bootstrap** - Slow release cycle. Bootstrap 4 has been in alpha for almost 2 years. Add a spinner button component, as it is widely used.\n* **Semantic UI** - Source code structure makes theme customization extremely hard to understand. Its unconventional theming system is a pain to customize. Hardcoded config path within the vendor library. Not well-designed for overriding variables unlike in Bootstrap.\n* **Bulma** - A lot of non-semantic and superfluous classes and markup required. Not backward compatible. Upgrading versions breaks the app in subtle manners.\n\n\n#### List out the data types that Sass supports \nSass supports seven main data types:\n\n* **Numbers** - most of the time they are accompanied by a unit of some sort but they are still technically numbers. You can perform basic mathematical operations on these values.\n\n```css\n$size: 18;                  \/\/ A number\n$px-unit: $size * 1px;      \/\/ A pixel measurement\n$px-string: $size + px;     \/\/ A string\n$px-number: $px-unit \/ 1px; \/\/ A number\n```\n* **Strings** - just like CSS, accepts both quoted and unquoted strings, even if they contain spaces\n\n```css\n$website: 'SitePoint'; \/\/ Stores SitePoint\n$name: 'Gajendar' + ' Singh';  \/\/ 'Gajendar Singh'\n$date:  'Month\/Year : ' + 3\/2016; \/\/ 'Month\/Year : 3\/2016'\n$date:  'Month\/Year : ' + (3\/2016); \/\/ 'Month\/Year : 0.00149' \n\/\/ This is because 3\/2016 is evaluated first.\n$variable: 3\/2016;      \/\/ Evaluated to 0.00149\n```\n* **Colors** - CSS color expressions come under the `color` data type. You can refer to the colors in hexadecimal notation, as `rgb`, `rgba`, `hsl` and `hsla` values or use native keywords like `pink`, `blue`, etc. \n\n```css\n$color: yellowgreen;           \/\/ #9ACD32\ncolor: lighten($color, 15%);    \/\/ #b8dc70\ncolor: darken($color, 15%);     \/\/ #6c9023\ncolor: saturate($color, 15%);   \/\/ #a1e01f\ncolor: desaturate($color, 15%); \/\/ #93ba45\ncolor: (green + red);           \/\/ #ff8000\n```\n* **Booleans** - has only two possible values: `true` and `false`\n\n```css\n$i-am-true: true;\n\nbody {\n  @if not $i-am-true {\n    background: rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.6);\n  } @else {\n    background: rgba(0, 0, 255, 0.6); \/\/ expected\n  }\n}\n```\n\n* **Null** -  is commonly used to define an empty state, neither `true` or `false`. This is typically the value you want to set when defining a variable without a value, only to prevent the parser from crashing.\n\n```css\n.foo {\n  content: type-of(null); \/\/ null\n  content: type-of(NULL); \/\/ string\n  $bar: 'foo' + null; \/\/ invalid null operation: \"foo plus null\u201d.\n}\n```\n\n* **Lists** - are just the Sass version of arrays. You can store multiple types of values in a list.\n\n```css\n$font-list: 'Raleway','Dosis','Lato'; \/\/ Three comma separated elements\n$pad-list: 10px 8px 12px; \/\/ Three space separated elements\n$multi-list: 'Roboto',15px 1.3em; \/\/ This multi-list has two lists.\n```\n* **Maps** -  Sass maps are like associative arrays. A map stores both keys and values associated with those keys.\n\n```css\n$styling: (\n  'font-family': 'Lato',\n  'font-size': 1.5em,\n  'color': tomato,\n  'background': black\n);\n\nh1 {\n  color: map-get($styling, 'color');\n  background: map-get($styling, 'background');\n}\n```\n\n\n#### Explain CSS sprites, and how you would implement them on a page or site. \n*CSS sprites* combine multiple images into one single larger image. It is commonly used technique for icons (Gmail uses it). \n\n* Use a sprite generator that packs multiple images into one and generate the appropriate CSS for it.\n* Each image would have a corresponding CSS class with `background-image`, `background-position` and `background-size` properties defined.\n* To use that image, add the corresponding class to your element.\n\n**Advantages**:\n\n* Reduce the number of HTTP requests for multiple images (only one single request is required per spritesheet). But with HTTP2, loading multiple images is no longer much of an issue.\n* Advance downloading of assets that won\u2019t be downloaded until needed, such as images that only appear upon `:hover` pseudo-states. Blinking wouldn't be seen.\n\n\n#### What Selector Nesting in Sass is used for? \nSass *let you nest* your CSS selectors in a way that follows the same visual hierarchy of your HTML.  CSS, on the other hand, doesn't have any visual hierarchy.\n\nConsider example (scss):\n```css\n.parent {\n  color: red;\n\n  .child {\n    color: blue;\n  }\n}\n```\nResult (css):\n```css\n.parent {\n  color: red;\n}\n\n.parent .child {\n  color: blue;\n}\n```\n\n\n\n#### Explain what is a @extend directive used for in Sass? \nUsing `@extend` lets you share a set of CSS properties from one selector to another. It helps keep your Sass very dry.\n\nConsider:\n```css\n%message-shared {\n  border: 1px solid #ccc;\n  padding: 10px;\n  color: #333;\n}\n\n.message {\n  @extend %message-shared;\n}\n\n.success {\n  @extend %message-shared;\n  border-color: green;\n}\n\n.error {\n  @extend %message-shared;\n  border-color: red;\n}\n\n.warning {\n  @extend %message-shared;\n  border-color: yellow;\n}\n```\nCSS output:\n```css\n.message, .success, .error, .warning {\n  border: 1px solid #cccccc;\n  padding: 10px;\n  color: #333;\n}\n\n.success {\n  border-color: green;\n}\n\n.error {\n  border-color: red;\n}\n\n.warning {\n  border-color: yellow;\n}\n```\n\n\n\n\n#### Explain the CSS \u201cbox model\u201d and the layout components that it consists of \nThe CSS box model is a rectangular layout paradigm for HTML elements that consists of the following:\n\n* **Content** - The content of the box, where text and images appear\n* **Padding** - A transparent area surrounding the content (i.e., the amount of space between the border and the content)\n* **Border** - A border surrounding the padding (if any) and content\n* **Margin** - A transparent area surrounding the border (i.e., the amount of space between the border and any neighboring elements)\n\n\n#### What is the difference between classes and IDs in CSS? \n* **IDs**\u200a\u2014\u200aMeant to be unique within the document. Can be used to identify an element when linking using a fragment identifier. Elements can only have one id attribute.\n\n* **Classes**\u200a\u2014\u200aCan be reused on multiple elements within the document. Mainly for styling and targeting elements.\n\n\n#### Describe floats and how they work \n*Float* is a CSS positioning property. Floated elements remain a part of the flow of the web page. This is distinctly different than page elements that use absolute positioning. Absolutely positioned page elements are removed from the flow of the webpage.\n\n```css\n#sidebar {\n  float: right; \/\/ left right none inherit          \n}\n```\nThe CSS clear property can be used to be positioned below `left`\/`right`\/`both` floated elements.\n\n\n## [[\u2b06]](#toc) Career Interview Questions\n## [[\u2b06]](#toc) Clojure Interview Questions\n## [[\u2b06]](#toc) Code Problems Interview Questions\n#### Test divisors of three \n**Details:**\nYou will be given 2 parameters: a low and high number. Your goal is to print all numbers between low and high, and for each of these numbers print whether or not the number is divisible by 3. If the number is divisible by 3, print the word \"div3\" directly after the number.\n\nWe'll solve this problem by first creating a loop that will print each number from low to high. Once we have the code for that written, we'll add a conditional that will check if the number is evenly divisible by 3 by using the mod operator.\n\n```js\nfunction test_divisors(low, high) {\n\n  \/\/ we'll store all numbers and strings within an array\n  \/\/ instead of printing directly to the console\n  var output = [];\n\n  for (var i = low; i <= high; i++) {\n\n    \/\/ simply store the current number in the output array\n    output.push(i);\n\n    \/\/ check if the current number is evenly divisible by 3\n    if (i % 3 === 0) { output.push('div3'); }\n\n  }\n\n  \/\/ return all numbers and strings\n  return output;\n\n}\n\ntest_divisors(2, 10);\n```\n\n\n#### Sum of Array Plus One \n**Details:**\nWrite a function that takes an array of integers and returns the sum of the integers after adding 1 to each.\n\n```js\n\/\/ ES5 method is nice and clean\nexports.es5 = function (array) {\n  return array.reduce(function (memo, num) {\n    return memo + num;\n  }, array.length);\n};\n\n\/\/ Without array.reduce method isn't much different\nexports.iterative = function (array) {\n  var result = array.length;\n\n  for (var i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {\n    result += array[i];\n  }\n\n  return result;\n};\n```\n\n\n#### String Rotation \n**Details:**\nFind out if a string is a rotation of another string. E.g. `ABCD` is a rotation of `BCDA` but not `ACBD`.\n\nFirst make sure `a` and `b` are of the same length. Then check to see if `b` is a substring of `a` concatenated with `a`:\n\n```js\nmodule.exports = function (a, b) {\n  return a.length === b.length && (a + a).indexOf(b) > -1;\n};\n```\n\n\n\n\n#### Oddball sum \n**Details:**\nWrite a function called `oddball_sum` which takes in a list of numbers and returns the sum of all the odd elements. Try to solve with and without `reduce` function.\n\nTo solve this challenge we'll simply loop through the array while maintaining a final count, and every time an odd number is encountered we'll add it to the count.\n\nWithout `reduce`:\n```js\nfunction oddball_sum(nums) {\n\n  \/\/ final count of all odd numbers added up\n  var final_count = 0;\n\n  \/\/ loop through entire list\n  for (var i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {\n\n    \/\/ we divide by 2, and if there is a remainder then\n    \/\/ the number must be odd so we add it to final_count\n    if (nums[i] % 2 === 1) {\n      final_count += nums[i]\n    }\n\n  }\n\n  return final_count;\n\n}\n\noddball_sum([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]); \n```\n\nWith `reduce`:\n\n```js\nfunction oddball_sum(nums) {\n  return nums.reduce(function(total, item){\n    if (item % 2 === 1) {\n        return total += item;\n    }\n    return total;\n  });\n}\n```\n\n\n#### Simple clock angle \n**Details:**\nYou will be given a number `N` that represents where the minute hand currently is on a clock. Your program should return the angle that is formed by the minute hand and the `12` o'clock mark on the clock.\n\nIf the input is `15` then your program should return `90` because a `90`-degree angle is formed by the minute hand and the `12` o'clock mark on the clock. We'll solve this challenge by first calculating what angle is created by each minute passing on a clock. Once we calculate this number, we multiply it by the input to determine the final angle. \n\nA method to solve such problems is to consider the rate of change of the angle in degrees per minute. The hour hand of a normal `12-hour` analogue clock turns `360\u00b0` in `12` hours (`720` minutes) or `0.5\u00b0` per minute. The minute hand rotates through `360\u00b0` in `60` minutes or `6\u00b0` per minute.\n\n```js\nfunction simpleClockAngle(num) {\n\n  \/\/ we got 6 because 360\/60 = 6\n  \/\/ 360 represents the full number of a degrees in a circle and\n  \/\/ 60 is the number of minutes on a clock, so dividing these two numbers\n  \/\/ gives us the number of degrees for one minute\n  return 6 * num;\n\n}\n\nsimpleClockAngle(15);\n```\n\n\n\n\n#### Sum of several arrays \n**Details:**\nYou will be given an array of several arrays that each contain integers and your goal is to write a function that will sum up all the numbers in all the arrays. For example, if the input is `[[3, 2], [1], [4, 12]]` then your program should output `22` because `3 + 2 + 1 + 4 + 12 = 22`. Solve without and with `reduce`.\n\nWe will solve this challenge by looping through the entire array, and then looping through each inner array adding up all the numbers.\n\n```js\nfunction sum_array(arr) {\n  \/\/ store our final answer\n  var sum = 0;\n  \/\/ loop through entire array\n  for (var i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {\n    \/\/ loop through each inner array\n    for (var j = 0; j < arr[i].length; j++) {\n      \/\/ add this number to the current final sum\n      sum += arr[i][j];\n    }\n  }\n\n  return sum;\n}\n\nsum_array([[3, 2], [1], [4, 12]]);\n```\n\nWith `reduce`:\n\n```js\nfunction sumArray(arr) {\n  return arr.reduce((t, e) => t.concat(e)).reduce((t, e) => t + e)\n}\n```\n\n\n#### Lucky sevens \n**Details:**\nWrite a function called `lucky_sevens` which takes an array of integers and returns true if any three consecutive elements sum to 7.\n\nTo solve this challenge we'll simply loop through the array starting at the 3rd position, and checking if the number at this index plus the two previous elements sums to 7. We continue doing this as we loop through the entire array. Once we find three elements that sum to 7, we simply return `true`. If we reach the end of the array without finding elements that sum to 7, we return `false`.\n\n```js\nfunction lucky_sevens(arr) {\n\n  \/\/ if less than 3 elements then this challenge is not possible\n  if (arr.length < 3) {\n    return \"not possible\";\n  }\n\n  \/\/ because we know there are at least 3 elements we can\n  \/\/ start the loop at the 3rd element in the array (i=2)\n  \/\/ and check it along with the two previous elements (i-1) and (i-2)\n  for (var i = 2; i < arr.length; i++) {\n    if (arr[i] + arr[i-1] + arr[i-2] === 7) {\n      return true; \n    }\n  }\n\n  \/\/ if loop is finished and no elements summed to 7\n  return false;\n\n}\n\nlucky_sevens([2, 1, 5, 1, 0]);\n``` \n\n\n\n\n#### Two sum problem \n**Details:**\nGiven an integer `x` and a sorted array a of `N` distinct integers, design a linear-time algorithm to determine if there exists two distinct indices `i` and `j` such that `a[i] + a[j] == x`\n\nFor example, if the array is `[3, 5, 2, -4, 8, 11]` and the sum is `7`, \nyour program should return `[[11, -4], [2, 5]]` because `11 + -4 = 7` and `2 + 5 = 7`.\n\nThe algorithm below makes use of hash tables which have a constant lookup time. As we pass through each element in the array, we check to see if S minus the current element exists in the hash table. We only need to loop through the array once, resulting in a running time of `O(n)` since each lookup and insertion in a hash table is `O(1)`.\n\n```js\n\/\/ our two sum function which will return\n\/\/ all pairs in the array that sum up to S\nfunction twoSum(arr, S) {\n\n  var sums = [];\n  var hashTable = {};\n\n  \/\/ check each element in array\n  for (var i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {\n\n    \/\/ calculate S - current element\n    var sumMinusElement = S - arr[i];\n\n    \/\/ check if this number exists in hash table\n    \/\/ if so then we found a pair of numbers that sum to S\n    if (hashTable[sumMinusElement.toString()] !== undefined) { \n      sums.push([arr[i], sumMinusElement]);\n    }\n\n    \/\/ add the current number to the hash table\n    hashTable[arr[i].toString()] = arr[i];\n\n  }\n\n  \/\/ return all pairs of integers that sum to S\n  return sums;\n\n}\n\ntwoSum([3, 5, 2, -4, 8, 11], 7);\n```\n\n\n\n\n#### Implement a queue using a linked list \nWe will store a reference to the front and back of the queue in order to make enqueuing and dequeuing run in `O(1)` constant time. Every time we want to insert into the queue, we add the new element to the end of the linked list and update the back pointer. When we want to dequeue we return the first node in the linked list and update the front pointer.\n\n```js\n\/\/ queue is initially empty\nvar Queue = {front: null, back: null};\n\n\/\/ we will use a node to keep track of the elements\n\/\/ in the queue which is represented by a linked list\nfunction Node(data, next) {\n  this.data = data;\n  this.next = next;\n} \n\n\/\/ add elements to queue in O(1) time\nfunction Enqueue(element) {\n  var N = new Node(element, null);\n  if (Queue.back === null) {\n    Queue.front = N;\n    Queue.back = N; \n  } else { \n    Queue.back.next = N; \n    Queue.back = Queue.back.next;\n  } \n}\n\n\/\/ remove first element from queue in O(1) time\nfunction Dequeue() {\n  if (Queue.front !== null) { \n    var first = Queue.front;\n    Queue.front = Queue.front.next; \n    return first.data;\n  } else {\n    if (Queue.back !== null) { Queue.back = null; }\n    return 'Cannot dequeue because queue is empty';\n  }\n}\n\nEnqueue('a'); \nEnqueue('b'); \nEnqueue('c'); \nDequeue();\n```\n\n\n#### Tree Level Order Print \n**Details:**\nGiven a binary tree of integers, print it in level order. The output will contain space between the numbers in the same level, and new line between different levels.\n\n```js\nmodule.exports = function (root) {\n  \/\/ Doing a breadth first search using recursion.\n  (function walkLevel (children) {\n    \/\/ Create a new queue for the next level.\n    var queue = [],\n        output;\n\n    \/\/ Use the map function to easily join all the nodes together while pushing\n    \/\/ it's children into the next level queue.\n    output = children.map(function (node) {\n      \/\/ Assuming the node has children stored in an array.\n      queue = queue.concat(node.children || []);\n      return node.value;\n    }).join(' ');\n\n    \/\/ Log the output at each level.\n    console.log(output);\n\n    \/\/ If the queue has values in it, recurse to the next level and walk\n    \/\/ along it.\n    queue.length && walkLevel(queue);\n  })([root]);\n};\n```\n\n\n\n#### Stock maximum profit \n**Details:**\nYou will be given a list of stock prices for a given day and your goal is to return the maximum profit that could have been made by buying a stock at the given price and then selling the stock later on. \n\nFor example if the input is: \n\n```js\n[45, 24, 35, 31, 40, 38, 11] \n```\n\nthen your program should return 16 because if you bought the stock at $24 and sold it at $40, a profit of $16 was made and this is the largest profit that could be made. If no profit could have been made, return -1.\n\nWe'll solve the challenge the following way:\n\n1. Iterate through each number in the list.\n2. At the ith index, get the `i+1` index price and check if it is larger than the ith index price.\n3. If so, set `buy_price = i` and `sell_price = i+1`. Then calculate the profit: `sell_price - buy_price`.\n4. If a stock price is found that is cheaper than the current `buy_price`, set this to be the new buying price and continue from step 2.\n5. Otherwise, continue changing only the `sell_price` and keep `buy_price` set.\n\nThis algorithm runs in linear time, making only one pass through the array, so the running time in the worst case is `O(n)`.\n\n```js\nfunction StockPicker(arr) { \n\n  var max_profit = -1;\n  var buy_price = 0;\n  var sell_price = 0;\n\n  \/\/ this allows our loop to keep iterating the buying\n  \/\/ price until a cheap stock price is found\n  var change_buy_index = true;\n\n  \/\/ loop through list of stock prices once\n  for (var i = 0; i < arr.length-1; i++) {\n\n    \/\/ selling price is the next element in list\n    sell_price = arr[i+1]; \n\n    \/\/ if we have not found a suitable cheap buying price yet\n    \/\/ we set the buying price equal to the current element\n    if (change_buy_index) { buy_price = arr[i]; }\n\n    \/\/ if the selling price is less than the buying price\n    \/\/ we know we cannot make a profit so we continue to the \n    \/\/ next element in the list which will be the new buying price\n    if (sell_price < buy_price) {\n      change_buy_index = true; \n      continue;\n    }\n\n    \/\/ if the selling price is greater than the buying price\n    \/\/ we check to see if these two indices give us a better \n    \/\/ profit then what we currently have\n    else { \n      var temp_profit = sell_price - buy_price;\n      if (temp_profit > max_profit) { max_profit = temp_profit; }\n      change_buy_index = false;\n    }\n\n  }\n\n  return max_profit;\n\n}\n\nStockPicker([44, 30, 24, 32, 35, 30, 40, 38, 15]);  \n```\n\n\n#### Find Word Positions in Text \n**Details:**\nGiven a text file and a word, find the positions that the word occurs in the file. We\u2019ll be asked to find the positions of many words in the same file.\n\nSince we\u2019ll have to answer multiple queries, precomputation would be useful. We\u2019ll build a data structure that stores the positions of all the words in the text file. This is known as inverted index.\n\n```js\nmodule.exports = function (text) {\n  var trie   = {},\n      pos    = 0,\n      active = trie; \/\/ Start the active structure as the root trie structure\n\n  \/\/ Suffix a space after the text to make life easier\n  text += ' ';\n\n  \/\/ Loop through the input text adding it to the trie structure\n  for (var i = 0; i < text.length; i++) {\n    \/\/ When the character is a space, restart\n    if (text[i] === ' ') {\n      \/\/ If the current active doesn't equal the root, set the position\n      if (active !== trie) {\n        (active.positions = active.positions || []).push(pos);\n      }\n      \/\/ Reset the positions and the active part of the data structure\n      pos    = i;\n      active = trie;\n      continue;\n    }\n\n    \/\/ Set the next character in the structure up\n    active[text[i]] = (active[text[i]] || {});\n    active = active[text[i]];\n  }\n\n  \/\/ Return a function that accepts a word and looks it up in the trie structure\n  return function (word) {\n    var i      = -1,\n        active = trie;\n\n    while (word[++i]) {\n      if (!active[word[i]]) { return []; }\n      active = active[word[i]];\n    }\n\n    return active.positions;\n  };\n};\n```\n\n\n#### Determine overlapping numbers in ranges \n**Details:**\nYou will be given an array with `5` numbers. The first 2 numbers represent a range, and the next two numbers represent another range. The final number in the array is `X`. The goal of your program is to determine if both ranges overlap by at least `X` numbers. For example, in the array `[4, 10, 2, 6, 3]` the ranges `4` to `10` and `2` to `6` overlap by at least `3` numbers `(4, 5, 6)`, so your program should return `true`. Solve with and without looping.\n\nIf the array is `[10, 20, 4, 14, 4]` then the ranges are:\n\n```sh\n10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20\n4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14\n```\n\nThese ranges overlap by at least `4` numbers, namely: `10, 11, 12, 13, 14` so your program should return `true`.\n\nWith loop:\n```js\nfunction OverlappingRanges(arr) {\n\n  \/\/ keep a count of how many numbers overlap\n  var counter = 0;\n\n  \/\/ loop through one of the ranges\n  for (var i = arr[0]; i < arr[1]; i++) {\n\n    \/\/ check if a number within the first range exists\n    \/\/ in the second range\n    if (i >= arr[2] && i <= arr[3]) { \n      counter += 1;\n    }\n\n  }\n\n  \/\/ check if the numbers that overlap is equal to or greater\n  \/\/ than the last number in the array\n  return (counter >= arr[4]) ? true : false;\n}\n\nOverlappingRanges([4, 10, 2, 6, 3]); \n```\n\nWithout loop:\n\n```js\nfunction overlapping(input){\n  var nums1 = listOfNums(input[0], input[1]);\n  var nums2 = listOfNums(input[2], input[3]);\n  var overlappingNum = 0;\n\n  if(nums1[0] >= nums2[0] && nums1[0] <= nums2[1]){\n    overlappingNum =  nums2[1] - nums1[0] + 1;\n  } else {\n    overlappingNum =  nums1[1] - nums2[0] + 1;\n  }\n  if(overlappingNum >= input[4]){\n    return true;\n  }\n}\n\nfunction listOfNums(a, b){\n  var start = a;\n  var end = b;\n  if(a > b){\n    start = b;\n    end = a;\n  }\n\n  return [a, b];\n}\n\nvar a = [4, 10, 2, 6, 3];\noverlapping(a)\n```\n\n\n\n#### Throttle Function Implementation \n**Details:**\nWrite a function that accepts a function and timeout, `x`, in number of milliseconds. It returns a function that can only be executed once per `x` milliseconds. This can be useful for limiting the number of time and computation heavy function that are run. For example, making AJAX requests to an autocompletion API.\n\nOnce written, add a third parameter that will allow the function to be executed immediately if set to true. Otherwise the function will run at the end of the timeout period.\n\n```js\nmodule.exports = function (fn, delay, execAsap) {\n  var timeout; \/\/ Keeps a reference to the timeout inside the returned function\n\n  return function () {\n    \/\/ Continue to pass through the function execution context and arguments\n    var that = this,\n        args = arguments;\n\n    \/\/ If there is no timeout variable set, proceed to create a new timeout\n    if (!timeout) {\n      execAsap && fn.apply(that, args);\n\n      timeout = setTimeout(function () {\n        execAsap || fn.apply(that, args);\n        \/\/ Remove the old timeout variable so the function can run again\n        timeout = null;\n      }, delay || 100);\n    }\n  };\n};\n```\n\n\n\n#### Dutch national flag sorting problem \n**Details:**\nFor this problem, your goal is to sort an array of `0`, `1`, `2` but you must do this in place, in linear time and without any extra space (such as creating an extra array). This is called the *Dutch national flag sorting problem*. For example, if the input array is `[2,0,0,1,2,1]` then your program should output `[0,0,1,1,2,2]` and the algorithm should run in `O(n)` time.\n\nThe solution to this algorithm will require 3 pointers to iterate throughout the array, swapping the necessary elements.\n\n1. Create a low pointer at the beginning of the array and a high pointer at the end of the array.\n2. Create a mid pointer that starts at the beginning of the array and iterates through each element.\n3. If the element at `arr[mid]` is a `2`, then swap `arr[mid]` and `arr[high]` and decrease the high pointer by `1`.\n4. If the element at `arr[mid]` is a `0`, then swap `arr[mid]` and `arr[low]` and increase the low and mid pointers by `1`.\n5. If the element at `arr[mid]` is a `1`, don't swap anything and just increase the mid pointer by `1`.\n\n```js\nfunction swap(arr, i1, i2) {\n  var temp = arr[i1];\n  arr[i1] = arr[i2];\n  arr[i2] = temp;\n}\n\nfunction dutchNatFlag(arr) {\n\n  var low = 0;\n  var mid = 0;\n  var high = arr.length - 1;\n\n  \/\/ one pass through the array swapping\n  \/\/ the necessary elements in place\n  while (mid <= high) {\n    if      (arr[mid] === 0) { swap(arr, low++, mid++); }\n    else if (arr[mid] === 2) { swap(arr, mid, high--); }\n    else if (arr[mid] === 1) { mid++; }\n  }\n\n  return arr;\n\n}\n\ndutchNatFlag([2,2,2,0,0,0,1,1]); \n```\n\n\n#### Step-by-step solution for step counting using recursion \n**Details:**\n\nSuppose you want climb a staircase of N steps, and on each step you can take either 1 or 2 steps. How many distinct ways are there to climb the staircase? For example, if you wanted to climb 4 steps, you can take the following distinct number of steps:\n\n```sh\n1) 1, 1, 1, 1\n2) 1, 1, 2\n3) 1, 2, 1\n4) 2, 1, 1\n5) 2, 2\n```\n\nSo there are 5 distinct ways to climb 4 steps. We want to write a function, using recursion, that will produce the answer for any number of steps. \n\n\nThe solution to this problem requires recursion, which means to solve for a particular `N`, we need the solutions for previous N's. The solution for N steps is equal to the solutions for `N - 1` steps plus `N - 2` steps.\n\n```js\nfunction countSteps(N) {\n\n  \/\/ just as in our solution explanation above, we know that to climb 1 step\n  \/\/ there is only 1 solution, and for 2 steps there are 2 solutions\n  if (N === 1) { return 1; }\n  if (N === 2) { return 2; }\n\n  \/\/ for all N > 2, we add the previous (N - 1) + (N - 2) steps to get\n  \/\/ an answer recursively\n  return countSteps(N - 1) + countSteps(N - 2);\n\n}\n\n\/\/ the solution for N = 6 will recursively be solved by calculating\n\/\/ the solution for N = 5, N = 4, N = 3, and N = 2 which we know is 2\ncountSteps(6); \n```\n\n\n\n#### Implement Bubble Sort \nThe steps in the bubble sort algorithm are:\n\n1. Loop through the whole array starting from index `1`\n2. If the number in the array at index `i-1` is greater than i, swap the numbers and continue\n3. Once the end of the array is reached, start looping again from the beginning\n4. Once no more elements can be swapped, the sorting is complete\n\n```js\nfunction swap(arr, i1, i2) {\n  var temp = arr[i1];\n  arr[i1] = arr[i2];\n  arr[i2] = temp;\n}\n\nfunction bubblesort(arr) {\n\n  var swapped = true;\n\n  \/\/ keep going unless no elements can be swapped anymore\n  while (swapped) {\n\n    \/\/ set swapped to false so that the loop stops\n    \/\/ unless two element are actually swapped\n    swapped = false;\n\n    \/\/ loop through the whole array swapping adjacent elements\n    for (var i = 1; i < arr.length; i++) {\n      if (arr[i-1] > arr[i]) {\n        swap(arr, i-1, i);\n        swapped = true;\n      }\n    }\n\n  }\n\n  return arr;\n\n}\n\nbubblesort([103, 45, 2, 1, 97, -4, 67]); \n```\n\n\n#### Implement a queue using two stacks \nSuppose we push `a`, `b`, `c` to a stack. If we are trying to implement a queue and we call the dequeue method 3 times, we actually want the elements to come out in the order: `a`, `b`, `c`, which is in the opposite order they would come out if we popped from the stack. So, basically, we need to access the elements in the reverse order that they exist in the stack. \n\n*Algorithm* for queue using two stacks:\n\n1. When calling the enqueue method, simply push the elements into the stack 1.\n2. If the dequeue method is called, push all the elements from stack 1 into stack 2, which reverses the order of the elements. Now pop from stack 2.\n\nThe worst case running time for implementing these operations using stacks is `O(n)` because you need to transfer n elements from stack 1 to stack 2 when a dequeue method is called. Pushing to stack 1 is simply `O(1)`.\n\n```js\n\/\/ implement stacks using plain arrays with push and pop functions\nvar Stack1 = [];\nvar Stack2 = [];\n\n\/\/ implement enqueue method by using only stacks\n\/\/ and the push and pop functions\nfunction Enqueue(element) {\n  Stack1.push(element);\n}\n\n\/\/ implement dequeue method by pushing all elements\n\/\/ from stack 1 into stack 2, which reverses the order\n\/\/ and then popping from stack 2\nfunction Dequeue() {\n  if (Stack2.length === 0) {\n    if (Stack1.length === 0) { return 'Cannot dequeue because queue is empty'; }\n    while (Stack1.length > 0) {\n      var p = Stack1.pop();\n      Stack2.push(p);\n    }\n  }\n  return Stack2.pop();\n}\n\nEnqueue('a');\nEnqueue('b');\nEnqueue('c');\nDequeue(); \n```\n\n\n## [[\u2b06]](#toc) Data Science Interview Questions\n#### What is Data Science? \nData Science is an interdisciplinary field of different scientific methods, techniques, processes, and knowledge that is used to transform the data of different types such as structured, unstructured and semi-structured data into the required format or representation.\n\nData Science concepts include different concepts such as statistics, regression, mathematics, computer science, algorithms, data structures and information science with also including some subfields such as data mining, machine learning, and databases etc.,\n\nData Science concept has recently evolved to a greater extent in the area of computing technology in order to perform data analysis on the existing data where the growth of data is in terms of an exponential with respect to time.\n\nData Science is the study of various types of data such as structured, semi-structured and unstructured data in any form or formats available in order to get some information out of it.\n\nData Science consists of different technologies used to study data such as data mining, data storing, data purging, data archival, data transformation etc., in order to make it efficient and ordered. Data Science also includes the concepts like Simulation, modeling, analytics, machine learning, computational mathematics etc.\n\n\n#### What is the best Programming Language to use in Data Science? \nData Science can be handled by using programming languages like Python or R programming language. These two are the two most popular languages being used by the Data Scientists or Data Analysts. R and Python are open source and are free to use and came into existence during the 1990s.\n\nPython and R have different advantages depending on the applications and required a business goal. Python is better to be used in the cases of repeated tasks or jobs and for data manipulations whereas R programming can be used for querying or retrieving datasets and customized data analysis.\n\nMostly Python is preferred for all types of data science applications where some time R programming is preferred in the cases of high or complex data applications. Python is easier to learn and has less learning curve whereas R has a deep learning curve.\n\nPython is mostly preferred in all the cases which is a general-purpose programming language and can be found in many applications other than Data Science too. R is mostly seen in Data Science area only where it is used for data analysis in standalone servers or computing separately.\n\n\n#### Why is data cleaning essential in Data Science? \nData cleaning is more important in Data Science because the end results or the outcomes of the data analysis come from the existing data where useless or unimportant need to be cleaned periodically as of when not required. This ensures the data reliability & accuracy and also memory is freed up.\n\nData cleaning reduces the data redundancy and gives good results in data analysis where some large customer information exists and that should be cleaned periodically. In the businesses like e-commerce, retail, government organizations contain large customer transaction information which is outdated and needs to be cleaned.\n\nDepending on the amount or size of data, suitable tools or methods should be used to clean the data from the database or big data environment. There are different types of data existing in a data source such as dirty data, clean data, mixed clean and dirty data and sample clean data.\n\nModern data science applications rely on machine learning model where the learner learns from the existing data. So, the existing data should always be cleanly and well maintained to get sophisticated and good outcomes during the optimization of the system.\n\n\n#### What is Linear Regression in Data Science? \nLinear Regression is a technique used in supervised machine learning algorithmic process in the area of Data Science. This method is used for predictive analysis.\n\nPredictive analytics is an area within Statistical Sciences where the existing information will be extracted and processed to predict the trends and outcomes pattern. The core of the subject lies in the analysis of existing context to predict an unknown event.\n\nThe process of Linear Regression method is to predict a variable called target variable by making the best relationship between the dependent variable and an independent variable. Here dependent variable is outcome variable and also response variable whereas the independent variable is predictor variable or explanatory variable.\n\nFor example in real life, depending on the expenses occurred in this financial year or monthly expenses, the predictions happen by calculating the approximate upcoming months or financial years expenses.\n\nIn this method, the implementation can be done by using Python programming technique where this is the most important method used in Machine Learning technique under the area of Data Science.\n\nLinear regression is also called Regression analysis that comes under the area of Statistical Sciences which is integrated together with Data Science.\n\n\n#### What is A\/B testing in Data Science? \nA\/B testing is also called as Bucket Testing or Split Testing. This is the method of comparing and testing two versions of systems or applications against each other to determine which version of application performs better. This is important in the cases where multiple versions are shown to the customers or end users in order to achieve the goals.\n\nIn the area of Data Science, this A\/B testing is used to know which variable out of the existing two variables in order to optimize or increase the outcome of the goal. A\/B testing is also called Design of Experiment. This testing helps in establishing a cause and effect relationship between the independent and dependent variables.\n\nThis testing is also simply a combination of design experimentation or statistical inference. Significance, Randomization and Multiple Comparisons are the key elements of the A\/B testing.\n\nThe significance is the term for the significance of statistical tests conducted. Randomization is the core component of the experimental design where the variables will be balanced. Multiple comparisons are the way of comparing more variables in the case of customer interests that causes more false positives resulting in the requirement of correction in the confidence level of a seller in the area of e-commerce.\n\nA\/B testing is the important one in the area of Data Science in predicting the outcomes.\n\n\n## [[\u2b06]](#toc) Data Structures Interview Questions\n#### What is data-structure? \nData structure availability may vary by programming languages. Commonly available data structures are:\n* list, \n* arrays, \n* stack, \n* queues, \n* graph, \n* tree etc.\n\n\n#### What is a graph? \nA **graph** is a pictorial representation of a set of objects where some pairs of objects are connected by links. The interconnected objects are represented by points termed as vertices, and the links that connect the vertices are called edges.\n\n\n#### What is linear searching? \n**Linear search** or sequential search is a method for finding a target value within a list. It sequentially checks each element of the list for the target value until a match is found or until all the elements have been searched. Linear search runs in at worst *linear time* and makes at most `n` comparisons, where `n` is the length of the list. \n\n* Worst-case performance    `O(n)`\n* Best-case performance `O(1)`\n* Average performance   `O(n)`\n* Worst-case space complexity   `O(1)` iterative\n\nIn theory other search algorithms may be faster than linear search (for instance binary search), in practice even on medium-sized arrays (around 100 items or less) it might be infeasible to use anything else. \n\n\n#### What is algorithm? \n**Algorithm** is a step by step procedure, which defines a set of instructions to be executed in certain order to get the desired output.\n\n\n#### What is linear data structure and what are common operations to perform on it? \nA *linear data-structure* has sequentially arranged data items. The next item can be located in the next memory address. It is stored and accessed in a sequential manner. **Array** and **list** are example of linear data structure.\n\nThe following operations are commonly performed on any data-structure:\n\n*   **Insertion** \u2212 adding a data item\n*   **Deletion** \u2212 removing a data item\n*   **Traversal** \u2212 accessing and\/or printing all data items\n*   **Searching** \u2212 finding a particular data item\n*   **Sorting** \u2212 arranging data items in a pre-defined sequence\n\n\n#### What is an average case complexity of Bubble Sort? \n**Bubble sort**, sometimes referred to as sinking sort, is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list to be sorted, compares each pair of adjacent items and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. The pass through the list is repeated until no swaps are needed, which indicates that the list is sorted. \n\nBubble sort has a worst-case and average complexity of `\u041e(n2)`, where `n` is the number of items being sorted. Most practical sorting algorithms have substantially better worst-case or average complexity, often `O(n log n)`. Therefore, bubble sort is not a practical sorting algorithm.\n\n\n\n\n#### What examples of greedy algorithms do you know? \nThe below given problems find their solution using greedy algorithm approach:\n\n*   Travelling Salesman Problem\n*   Prim's Minimal Spanning Tree Algorithm\n*   Kruskal's Minimal Spanning Tree Algorithm\n*   Dijkstra's Minimal Spanning Tree Algorithm\n*   Graph - Map Coloring\n*   Graph - Vertex Cover\n*   Knapsack Problem\n*   Job Scheduling Problem\n\n\n#### What are some examples of divide and conquer algorithms? \nThe below given problems find their solution using divide and conquer algorithm approach:\n\n*   Merge Sort\n*   Quick Sort\n*   Binary Search\n*   Strassen's Matrix Multiplication\n*   Closest pair (points)\n\n\n#### What are some examples of dynamic programming algorithms? \nThe below given problems find their solution using divide and conquer algorithm approach:\n\n*   Fibonacci number series\n*   Knapsack problem\n*   Tower of Hanoi\n*   All pair shortest path by Floyd-Warshall\n*   Shortest path by Dijkstra\n*   Project scheduling\n\n\n#### Why do we use stacks? \nIn data-structure, **stack** is an Abstract Data Type (ADT) used to store and retrieve values in Last In First Out (LIFO) method.\n\nStacks follows LIFO method and addition and retrieval of a data item takes only `\u039f(n)` time. Stacks are used where we need to access data in the reverse order or their arrival. Stacks are used commonly in recursive function calls, expression parsing, depth first traversal of graphs etc.\n\nThe below operations can be performed on a stack:\n\n*   **push()** \u2212 adds an item to stack\n*   **pop()** \u2212 removes the top stack item\n*   **peek()** \u2212 gives value of top item without removing it\n*   **isempty()** \u2212 checks if stack is empty\n*   **isfull()** \u2212 checks if stack is full\n\n\n#### Why do we use queues? \n**Queue** is an abstract data structure (ADS), somewhat similar to stack. In contrast to stack, queue is opened at both end. One end is always used to insert data (enqueue) and the other is used to remove data (dequeue). Queue follows First-In-First-Out (FIFO) methodology, i.e., the data item stored first will be accessed first.\n\nAs queues follows FIFO method, they are used when we need to work on data-items in exact sequence of their arrival. Every operating system maintains queues of various processes. Priority queues and breadth first traversal of graphs are some examples of queues.\n\nThe below operations can be performed on a queue:\n*   **enqueue()** \u2212 adds an item to rear of the queue\n*   **dequeue()** \u2212 removes the item from front of the queue\n*   **peek()** \u2212 gives value of front item without removing it\n*   **isempty()** \u2212 checks if stack is empty\n*   **isfull()** \u2212 checks if stack is full\n\n\n#### What is Selection Sort? \n**Selection sort** is in-place sorting technique. It divides the data set into two sub-lists: sorted and unsorted. Then it selects the minimum element from unsorted sub-list and places it into the sorted list. This iterates unless all the elements from unsorted sub-list are consumed into sorted sub-list.\n\n\n#### Why we need to do algorithm analysis? \nA problem can be solved in more than one ways. So, many solution algorithms can be derived for a given problem. We analyze available algorithms to find and implement the best suitable algorithm.\n\nAn algorithm are generally analyzed on two factors \u2212 time and space. That is, how much **execution** time and how much **extra space** required by the algorithm.\n\n\n#### What is the difference between Linear Search and Binary Search? \n* A **linear search** looks down a list, one item at a time, without jumping. In complexity terms this is an `O(n)` search - the time taken to search the list gets bigger at the same rate as the list does.\n\n* A **binary search** is when you start with the middle of a sorted list, and see whether that's greater than or less than the value you're looking for, which determines whether the value is in the first or second half of the list. Jump to the half way through the sublist, and compare again etc. In complexity terms this is an `O(log n)` search - the number of search operations grows more slowly than the list does, because you're halving the \"search space\" with each operation.\n\nComparing the two:\n\n- Binary search requires the input data to be sorted; linear search doesn't\n- Binary search requires an *ordering* comparison; linear search only requires equality comparisons\n- Binary search has complexity `O(log n)`; linear search has complexity O(n)\n- Binary search requires random access to the data; linear search only requires sequential access (this can be very important - it means a linear search can *stream* data of arbitrary size)\n\n\n#### What is asymptotic analysis of an algorithm? \n**Asymptotic analysis** of an algorithm, refers to defining the mathematical boundation\/framing of its run-time performance. Using asymptotic analysis, we can very well conclude the best case, average case and worst case scenario of an algorithm.\n\nAsymptotic analysis can provide three levels of mathematical binding of execution time of an algorithm:\n\n*   Best case is represented by \u03a9(n) notation.\n*   Worst case is represented by \u039f(n) notation.\n*   Average case is represented by \u0398(n) notation.\n\n\n## [[\u2b06]](#toc) Design Patterns Interview Questions\n#### What are the main categories of Design Patterns? \nThe Design patterns can be classified into three main categories:\n\n* Creational Patterns\n* Behavioral Patterns\n* Functional Patterns\n\n\n#### What is a pattern? \n*Patterns* in programming are like recipes in cooking. They are not ready dishes, but instructions for slicing and dicing products, cooking them, serving them and so forth.\n\n**Pattern content**\nAs a rule, a pattern description consists of the following:\n\n* a problem that the pattern solves;\n* motivation for solving the the problem using the method suggested by the pattern;\n* structures of classes comprising the solution;\n* an example in one of the programming languages;\n* a description of the nuances of pattern implementation in various contexts;\nrelations with other patterns.\n\n\n#### What is Singleton pattern? \n**Singleton pattern** comes under *creational* patterns category and introduces a single class which is responsible to create an object while making sure that only single object gets created. This class provides a way to access its only object which can be accessed directly without need to instantiate the object of the class.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n#### What is Design Patterns and why anyone should use them? \nDesign patterns are a well-described solution to the most commonly encountered problems which occur during software development. \n\nDesign pattern represents the best practices evolved over a period of time by experienced software developers. They promote reusability which leads to a more robust and maintainable code.\n\n\n#### What is Factory pattern? \n**Factory pattern** is one of most used design pattern and comes under *creational* patterns category.\n\nIn Factory pattern, we create object without exposing the creation logic to the client and refer to newly created object using a *common interface*.\n\n\n\n\n\n**Pro's**:  \n\n*   Allows you to hide implementation of an application seam (the core interfaces that make up your application)\n*   Allows you to easily test the seam of an application (that is to mock\/stub) certain parts of your application so you can build and test the other parts\n*   Allows you to change the design of your application more readily, this is known as loose coupling\n\n**Con's**  \n\n*   Makes code more difficult to read as all of your code is behind an abstraction that may in turn hide abstractions.\n*   Can be classed as an anti-pattern when it is incorrectly used, for example some people use it to wire up a whole application when using an IOC container, instead use Dependency Injection.\n\n\n#### What is Iterator pattern? \n**Iterator pattern** is very commonly used design pattern in Java and .Net programming environment. This pattern is used to get a way to access the elements of a collection object in sequential manner without any need to know its underlying representation. Iterator pattern falls under _behavioral_ pattern category.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n#### What is Inversion of Control? \n\n*Inversion of control* is a broad term but for a software developer it's most commonly described as a pattern used for decoupling components and layers in the system. \n\nFor example, say your application has a text editor component and you want to provide spell checking. Your standard code would look something like this:\n```js\npublic class TextEditor {\n\n    private SpellChecker checker;\n\n    public TextEditor() {\n        this.checker = new SpellChecker();\n    }\n}\n```\nWhat we've done here creates a dependency between the TextEditor and the SpellChecker. In an IoC scenario we would instead do something like this:\n```js\npublic class TextEditor {\n\n    private IocSpellChecker checker;\n\n    public TextEditor(IocSpellChecker checker) {\n        this.checker = checker;\n    }\n}\n```\n\nYou have *inverted control* by handing the responsibility of instantiating the spell checker from the TextEditor class to the caller.\n\n```js\nSpellChecker sc = new SpellChecker; \/\/ dependency\nTextEditor textEditor = new TextEditor(sc);\n```\n\n\n\n#### Can we create a clone of a singleton object? \nYesl, we can but the purpose of Singleton Object creation is to have single instance serving all requests. \n\n\n#### Name types of Design Patterns? \nDesign patterns can be classified in three categories: Creational, Structural and Behavioral patterns.\n\n-   Creational Patterns\u00a0- These design patterns provide a way to create objects while hiding the creation logic, rather than instantiating objects directly using new opreator. This gives program more flexibility in deciding which objects need to be created for a given use case.\n\n-   Structural Patterns\u00a0- These design patterns concern class and object composition. Concept of inheritance is used to compose interfaces and define ways to compose objects to obtain new functionalities.\n\n-   Behavioral Patterns\u00a0- These design patterns are specifically concerned with communication between objects.\n\n\n#### What is Template pattern? \nIn **Template pattern**, an abstract class exposes defined way(s)\/template(s) to execute its methods. Its subclasses can override the method implementation as per need but the invocation is to be in the same way as defined by an abstract class. This pattern comes under _behavior_ pattern category.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n#### What is Filter pattern? \n**Filter pattern** or **Criteria pattern** is a design pattern that enables developers to filter a set of objects using different criteria and chaining them in a decoupled way through logical operations. This type of design pattern comes under *structural* pattern as this pattern combines multiple criteria to obtain single criteria.\n\n**Filter design pattern** is useful where you want to add filters dynamically or you are implementing multiple functionalities and most of them require different filter criteria to filter something. In that case instead of hard coding the filters inside the functionalities, you can create filter criteria and re-use it wherever required.\n\n```js\nList laptops = LaptopFactory.manufactureInBulk();\nAndCriteria searchCriteria = new AndCriteria(\n  new HardDisk250GBFilter(), \n  new MacintoshFilter(), \n  new I5ProcessorFilter());\nList filteredLaptops = searchCriteria.meets(laptops);\n```\n\n\n#### What is Strategy pattern? \nIn **Strategy pattern**, a class behavior or its algorithm can be changed at run time. This type of design pattern comes under _behavior_ pattern.\n\nIn Strategy pattern, we create objects which represent various strategies and a context object whose behavior varies as per its strategy object. The strategy object changes the executing algorithm of the context object.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n#### What is Dependency Injection? \n*Dependency injection* makes it easy to create loosely coupled components, which typically means that components consume functionality defined by interfaces without having any first-hand knowledge of which implementation classes are being used.\n\n*Dependency injection* makes it easier to change the behavior of an application by changing the components that implement the interfaces that define application features. It also results in components that are easier to isolate for unit testing.\n\n\n#### What is Null Object pattern? \nIn **Null Object pattern**, a null object replaces check of NULL object instance. Instead of putting if check for a null value, Null Object reflects a do nothing relationship. Such Null object can also be used to provide default behaviour in case data is not available.\n\nIn Null Object pattern, we create an abstract class specifying various operations to be done, concrete classes extending this class and a null object class providing do nothing implementation of this class and will be used seamlessly where we need to check null value.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n#### What is State pattern? \nIn **State pattern** a class behavior changes based on its state. This type of design pattern comes under _behavior_ pattern. In State pattern, we create objects which represent various states and a context object whose behavior varies as its state object changes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n#### What is Proxy pattern? \nIn **proxy pattern**, a class represents functionality of another class. This type of design pattern comes under _structural_ pattern.\n\nIn proxy pattern, we create object having original object to interface its functionality to outer world.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n#### What is Builder pattern? \n*Builder pattern* builds a complex object using simple objects and using a step by step approach. This builder is independent of other objects.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Director class is optional and is used to make sure that the building steps are executed in the right order with the right data by the right builder. It's about validation and delegation.Builder\/Director pattern's steps invocations could be semantically presented by method chaining or so called Fluent Interface syntax. js\nPizza pizza = new Pizza.Builder()\n                       .cheese(true)\n                       .pepperoni(true)\n                       .bacon(true)\n                       .build();[\u2b06] DevOps Interview Questions"},{"question":"Explain what is DevOps ?","answer":"DevOps is a newly emerging term in IT field, which is nothing but a practice that emphasizes the collaboration and communication of both software developers and other information-technology (IT) professionals.

It can track changes to a file and allows you to revert back to any particular change.Its distributed architecture provides many advantages over other Version Control Systems (VCS) like SVN one major advantage is that it does not rely on a central server to store all the versions of a project\u2019s files."},{"question":"What's the difference between a \"pull request\" and a \"branch\"?","answer":"A branch is just a separate version of the code.\n\n\nA pull request is when someone take the repository, makes their own branch, does some changes, then tries to merge that branch in (put their changes in the other person's code repository)."},{"question":"What is Git fork? What is difference between fork, branch and clone?","answer":"A fork is a remote, server-side copy of a repository, distinct from the original. A fork isn't a Git concept really, it's more a political\/social idea. \nA clone is not a fork; a clone is a local copy of some remote repository.  When you clone, you are actually copying the entire source repository, including all the history and branches.\nA branch is a mechanism to handle the changes within a single repository in order to eventually merge them with the rest of code. A branch is something that is within a repository. Conceptually, it represents a thread of development."},{"question":"What is the difference between \"git pull\" and \"git fetch\"?","answer":"In the simplest terms, git pull does a git fetch followed by a git merge.\n\nWhen you use pull, Git tries to automatically do your work for you. It is context sensitive, so Git will merge any pulled commits into the branch you are currently working in.  pull automatically merges the commits without letting you review them first. If you don\u2019t closely manage your branches, you may run into frequent conflicts.\n\n\nWhen you fetch, Git gathers any commits from the target branch that do not exist in your current branch and stores them in your local repository. However, it does not merge them with your current branch. This is particularly useful if you need to keep your repository up to date, but are working on something that might break if you update your files. To integrate the commits into your master branch, you use merge."},{"question":"How does the Centralized Workflow work?","answer":"The Centralized Workflow uses a central repository to serve as the single point-of-entry for all changes to the project. The default development branch is called master and all changes are committed into this branch.Developers start by cloning the central repository. In their own local copies of the project, they edit files and commit changes. These new commits are stored locally.To publish changes to the official project, developers push their local master branch to the central repository. Before the developer can publish their feature, they need to fetch the updated central commits and rebase their changes on top of them. Compared to other workflows, the Centralized Workflow has no defined pull request or forking patterns."},{"question":"You need to update your local repos.

Programs are constructed using packages, for efficient management of dependencies. Go programming implementations use a traditional compile and link model to generate executable binaries."},{"question":"Is Go a new language, framework or library?","answer":"Go isn't a library and not a framework, it's a new language. Go is mostly in the C family (basic syntax), with significant input from the Pascal\/Modula\/Oberon family (declarations, packages). Go does have an extensive library, called the runtime, that is part of every Go program. Although it is more central to the language, Go's runtime is analogous to libc, the C library. It is important to understand, however, that Go's runtime does not include a virtual machine, such as is provided by the Java runtime. Go programs are compiled ahead of time to native machine code."},{"question":"Can you declared multiple types of variables in single declaration in Go?","answer":"Yes.

Compiler don't need a variable to have type statically as a necessary requirement."},{"question":"What are Goroutines?","answer":"Goroutines are functions or methods that run concurrently with other functions or methods. Goroutines can be thought of as light weight threads. The cost of creating a Goroutine is tiny when compared to a thread. Its common for Go applications to have thousands of Goroutines running concurrently."},{"question":"Let's talk variable declaration in Go. Could you explain what is a variable \"zero value\"?","answer":"Variable is the name given to a memory location to store a value of a specific type. There are various syntaxes to declare variables in go.```go\n\/\/ 1 - variable declaration, then assignment\nvar age int\nage = 29\/\/ 2 - variable declaration with initial value\nvar age2 int = 29\/\/ 3 - Type inference\nvar age3 = 29\/\/ 4 - declaring multiple variables\nvar width, height int = 100, 50\/\/ 5 - declare variables belonging to different types in a single statement\nvar (\n      name1 = initialvalue1,\n      name2 = initialvalue2\n)\n\/\/ 6 - short hand declaration\nname, age4 := \"naveen\", 29 \/\/short hand declaration\n```If a variable is not assigned any value, go automatically initialises it with the zero value of the variable's type. Go is strongly typed, so variables declared as belonging to one type cannot be assigned a value of another type."},{"question":"What kind of type conversion is supported by Go?","answer":"Go is very strict about explicit typing. There is no automatic type promotion or conversion. Explicit type conversion is required to assign a variable of one type to another.

This is a misconception, GraphQL is a query language for APIs - not databases. In that sense it\u2019s database agnostic and can be used with any kind of database or even no database at all."},{"question":"What is GraphQL?","answer":"GraphQL is a query language created by Facebook in 2012 which provides a common interface between the client and the server for data fetching and manipulations.The client asks for various data from the GraphQL server via queries. The response format is described in the query and defined by the client instead of the server: they are called client\u2010specified queries.\nThe structure of the data is not hardcoded as in traditional REST APIs - this makes retrieving data from the server more efficient for the client."},{"question":"Is GraphQL only for React \/ Javascript Developers?","answer":"No. GraphQL is an API technology so it can be used in any context where an API is required.On the backend, a GraphQL server can be implemented in any programming language that can be used to build a web server. Next to Javascript, there are popular reference implementations for Ruby, Python, Scala, Java, Clojure, Go and .NET.Since a GraphQL API is usually operated over HTTP, any client that can speak HTTP is able to query data from a GraphQL server.Note: GraphQL is actually transport layer agnostic, so you could choose other protocols than HTTP to implement your server."},{"question":"What is an exclamation point in GraphQL?","answer":"That means that the field is non-nullable. By default, all types in GraphQL are nullable. When non-null is applied to the type of a field, it means that if the server resolves that field to null, the response will fail validation."},{"question":"How to do Error Handling?","answer":"A successful GraphQL query is supposed to return a JSON object with a root field called \"data\". If the request fails or partially fails (e.g. because the user requesting the data doesn\u2019t have the right access permissions), a second root field called \"errors\" is added to the response:\njs\n    {\n      \"data\": { ... },\n      \"errors\": [ ... ]\n    }"},{"question":"Where is GraphQL useful?","answer":"GraphQL helps where your client needs a flexible response format to avoid extra queries and\/or massive data transformation with the overhead of keeping them in sync.Using a GraphQL server makes it very easy for a client side developer to change the response format without any change on the backend.With GraphQL, you can describe the required data in a more natural way. It can speed up development, because in application structures like top-down rendering in React, the required data is more similar to your component structure."},{"question":"What is difference between Mutation and Query?","answer":"Technically any GraphQL query could be implemented to cause a data write. But there is a convention that any operations that cause writes should be sent explicitly via a mutation.Besides the difference in the semantic, there is one important technical difference:Query fields can be executed in parallel by the GraphQL engine while Mutation top-level fields MUST execute serially according to the spec."},{"question":"What is GraphQL schema?","answer":"Every GraphQL server has two core parts that determine how it works: a schema and resolve functions.The schema is a model of the data that can be fetched through the GraphQL server. It defines what queries clients are allowed to make, what types of data can be fetched from the server, and what the relationships between these types are.

Since Angular services are singletons, data stored in services can be accessed across other Angular controllers.As mentioned, UI-router provides a resolve configuration. For example:\njs\n$stateProvider\n  .state('todos', {\n    url: '\/todos',\n    controller: 'TodosCtrl',\n    templateUrl: 'todos.html',\n    resolve: {\n      todos: function(TodosService) {\n        return TodosService.getTodos()\n      }\n    }\n  })One advantage of resolve over stateful services is better testing: as resolve injects dependencies in the controller, it is easy to test them.When using Ionic v.4 you have 3 options:\n1. Using Query Params (bad)\n2. Service and Resolve Function (legit)\n3. Using Router Extras State (new since Angular 7.2)js\n openDetailsWithState() {\n    let navigationExtras: NavigationExtras = {\n      state: {\n        user: this.user\n      }\n    };\n    this.router.navigate(['details'], navigationExtras);\n  }[\u2b06] JSON Interview Questions"},{"question":"What is JSON and why would I use it?","answer":"JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight format that is used for data interchanging. It is based on a subset of JavaScript language (the way objects are built in JavaScript). Some JavaScript is not JSON, and some JSON is not JavaScript."},{"question":"What is the correct JSON content type?","answer":"The MIME media type for JSON text is application\/json. The default encoding is UTF-8. (Source: RFC 4627)."},{"question":"How should I parse a JSON string in JavaScript?","answer":"The standard way to parse JSON in JavaScript is JSON.parse()The JSON API was introduced with ES5 (2011) and has since been implemented in >99% of browsers by market share, and Node.js. Its usage is simple:js\nconst json = '{ \"fruit\": \"pineapple\", \"fingers\": 10 }';\nconst obj = JSON.parse(json);\nconsole.log(obj.fruit, obj.fingers);[\u2b06] Java Interview Questions"},{"question":"What is JVM? Why is Java called the \u201cPlatform Independent Programming Language\u201d?","answer":"A Java virtual machine (JVM) is a process virtual machine that can execute Java bytecode. Each Java source file is compiled into a bytecode file, which is executed by the JVM. Java was designed to allow application programs to be built that could be run on any platform, without having to be rewritten or recompiled by the programmer for each separate platform. A Java virtual machine makes this possible, because it is aware of the specific instruction lengths and other particularities of the underlying hardware platform."},{"question":"What is a Servlet?","answer":"The servlet is a Java programming language class used to process client requests and generate dynamic web content. Servlets are mostly used to process or store data submitted by an HTML form, provide dynamic content and manage state information that does not exist in the stateless HTTP protocol."},{"question":"What is the Difference between JDK and JRE?","answer":"The Java Runtime Environment (JRE) is basically the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) where your Java programs are being executed. It also includes browser plugins for applet execution. \n\n\nThe Java Development Kit (JDK) is the full featured Software Development Kit for Java, including the JRE, the compilers and tools (like JavaDoc, and Java Debugger), in order for a user to develop, compile and execute Java applications."},{"question":"What is a JSP Page?","answer":"A Java Server Page (JSP) is a text document that contains two types of text: \n* static data and \n* JSP elements. Static data can be expressed in any text-based format, such as HTML or XML. JSP is a technology that mixes static content with dynamically-generated content."},{"question":"What is the difference between an Applet and a Java Application?","answer":"Applets are executed within a Java enabled browser, but a \nJava application is a standalone Java program that can be executed outside of a browser. \nHowever, they both require the existence of a Java Virtual Machine (JVM). Furthermore, a Java application requires a main method with a specific signature, in order to start its execution. Java applets don\u2019t need such a method to start their execution. Finally, Java applets typically use a restrictive security policy, while Java applications usually use more relaxed security policies."},{"question":"What are the two types of Exceptions in Java? Which are the differences between them?","answer":"Java has two types of exceptions: checked exceptions and unchecked exceptions. \n\nUnchecked exceptions do not need to be declared in a method or a constructor\u2019s throws clause, if they can be thrown by the execution of the method or the constructor, and propagate outside the method or constructor boundary. \n\n\nOn the other hand, checked exceptions must be declared in a method or a constructor\u2019s throws clause."},{"question":"How do I efficiently iterate over each entry in a Java Map?","answer":"Consider:\njava\nMap<String, String> map = ...\nfor (Map.Entry<String, String> entry : map.entrySet()) {\n    System.out.println(entry.getKey() + \"\/\" + entry.getValue());\n}\nIn Java 8 you can do it clean and fast using the new lambdas features:\njava\nfinal long[] i = {0};\nmap.forEach((k, v) -> i[0] += k + v);"},{"question":"Explain Serialization and Deserialization.","answer":"Java provides a mechanism, called object serialization where an object can be represented as a sequence of bytes and includes the object\u2019s data, as well as information about the object\u2019s type, and the types of data stored in the object. Thus, serialization can be seen as a way of flattening objects, in order to be stored on disk, and later, read back and reconstituted. Deserialisation is the reverse process of converting an object from its flattened state to a live object."},{"question":"What is the difference between an Interface and an Abstract class?","answer":"Java provides and supports the creation both of abstract classes and interfaces. Both implementations share some common characteristics, but they differ in the following features:\nAll methods in an interface are implicitly abstract. On the other hand, an abstract class may contain both abstract and non-abstract methods.\nA class may implement a number of Interfaces, but can extend only one abstract class.\nIn order for a class to implement an interface, it must implement all its declared methods. However, a class may not implement all declared methods of an abstract class. Though, in this case, the sub-class must also be declared as abstract.\nAbstract classes can implement interfaces without even providing the implementation of interface methods.\nVariables declared in a Java interface is by default final. An abstract class may contain non-final variables.\nMembers of a Java interface are public by default. A member of an abstract class can either be private, protected or public.\nAn interface is absolutely abstract and cannot be instantiated. An abstract class also cannot be instantiated, but can be invoked if it contains a main method."},{"question":"What are pass by reference and pass by value?","answer":"When an object is passed by value, this means that a copy of the object is passed. Thus, even if changes are made to that object, it doesn\u2019t affect the original value. \nWhen an object is passed by reference, this means that the actual object is not passed, rather a reference of the object is passed. Thus, any changes made by the external method, are also reflected in all places."},{"question":"What is the difference between processes and threads?","answer":"The main difference between them is that \n* a Process is a program which is executing some code and \n* a Thread is an independent path of execution in the process. A process can have more than one thread for doing independent task e.g. a thread for reading data from disk, a thread for processing that data and another thread for sending that data over the network."},{"question":"What\u2019s the difference between sendRedirect and forward methods?","answer":"The sendRedirect method creates a new request, while the forward method just forwards a request to a new target. The previous request scope objects are not available after a redirect, because it results in a new request. On the other hand, the previous request scope objects are available after forwarding. FInally, in general, the sendRedirect method is considered to be slower compare to the forward method."},{"question":"Explain the architechure of a Servlet.","answer":"The core abstraction that must be implemented by all servlets is the javax.servlet.Servlet interface. Each servlet must implement it either directly or indirectly, either by extending javax.servlet.GenericServlet or javax.servlet.http.HTTPServlet. Finally, each servlet is able to serve multiple requests in parallel using multithreading."},{"question":"What are JSP actions?","answer":"JSP actions use constructs in XML syntax to control the behavior of the servlet engine. JSP actions are executed when a JSP page is requested. They can be dynamically inserted into a file, re-use JavaBeans components, forward the user to another page, or generate HTML for the Java plugin.Some of the available actions are listed below:\njsp:include \u2013 includes a file, when the JSP page is requested.\njsp:useBean \u2013 finds or instantiates a JavaBean.\njsp:setProperty \u2013 sets the property of a JavaBean.\njsp:getProperty \u2013 gets the property of a JavaBean.\njsp:forward \u2013 forwards the requester to a new page.\njsp:plugin \u2013 generates browser-specific code."},{"question":"What are Expressions?","answer":"A JSP expression is used to insert the value of a scripting language expression, converted into a string, into the data stream returned to the client, by the web server. Expressions are defined between <% = and %> tags."},{"question":"What are Decalarations?","answer":"Declarations are similar to variable declarations in Java. Declarations are used to declare variables for subsequent use in expressions or scriptlets. To add a declaration, you must use the sequences to enclose your declarations."},{"question":"What does the \u201cstatic\u201d keyword mean? Can you override private or static method in Java?","answer":"The static keyword denotes that a member variable or method can be accessed, without requiring an instantiation of the class to which it belongs. A user cannot override static methods in Java, because method overriding is based upon dynamic binding at runtime and static methods are statically binded at compile time. A static method is not associated with any instance of a class so the concept is not applicable."},{"question":"What are the basic interfaces of Java Collections Framework?","answer":"Java Collections Framework provides a well designed set of interfaces and classes that support operations on a collections of objects. The most basic interfaces that reside in the Java Collections Framework are:\nCollection, which represents a group of objects known as its elements.\nSet, which is a collection that cannot contain duplicate elements.\nList, which is an ordered collection and can contain duplicate elements.\nMap,  which is an object that maps keys to values and cannot contain duplicate keys."},{"question":"What are Directives?","answer":"What are the different types of Directives available in JSP ? Directives are instructions that are processed by the JSP engine, when the page is compiled to a servlet. Directives are used to set page-level instructions, insert data from external files, and specify custom tag libraries. Directives are defined between < %@ and % >.The different types of directives are shown below:\nInclude directive: it is used to include a file and merges the content of the file with the current page.\nPage directive: it is used to define specific attributes in the JSP page, like error page and buffer.\nTaglib: it is used to declare a custom tag library which is used in the page."},{"question":"What is an Iterator?","answer":"The Iterator interface provides a number of methods that are able to iterate over any Collection. Each Java Collection contains the Iterator  method that returns an Iterator  instance. Iterators are capable of removing elements from the underlying collection during the iteration."},{"question":"How are the JSP requests handled?","answer":"On the arrival of a JSP request, the browser first requests a page with a .jsp extension. Then, the Web server reads the request and using the JSP compiler, the Web server converts the JSP page into a servlet class. Notice that the JSP file is compiled only on the first request of the page, or if the JSP file has changed.The generated servlet class is invoked, in order to handle the browser\u2019s request. Once the execution of the request is over, the servlet sends a response back to the client. See how to get Request parameters in a JSP."},{"question":"What is Function Overriding and Overloading in Java?","answer":"Method overloading in Java occurs when two or more methods in the same class have the exact same name, but different parameters. \n```java\nclass Dog{\n    public void bark(){\n        System.out.println(\"woof \");\n    }\/\/overloading method\npublic void bark(int num){\n    for(int i=0; i<num; i++)\n        System.out.println(\"woof \");\n}\n}\n```\nOn the other hand, method overriding is defined as the case when a child class redefines the same method as a parent class. Overridden methods must have the same name, argument list, and return type. The overriding method may not limit the access of the method it overrides.\n```java\nclass Dog{\n    public void bark(){\n        System.out.println(\"woof \");\n    }\n}\nclass Hound extends Dog{\n    public void sniff(){\n        System.out.println(\"sniff \");\n    }public void bark(){\n    System.out.println(\"bowl\");\n}\n}public class OverridingTest{\n    public static void main(String [] args){\n        Dog dog = new Hound();\n        dog.bark();\n    }\n}\n```"},{"question":"How HashMap works in Java?","answer":"A HashMap in Java stores key-value pairs. The HashMap requires a hash function and uses hashCode and equals methods, in order to put and retrieve elements to and from the collection respectively. When the put method is invoked, the HashMap calculates the hash value of the key and stores the pair in the appropriate index inside the collection. If the key exists, its value is updated with the new value. Some important characteristics of a HashMap are its capacity, its load factor and the threshold resizing."},{"question":"What differences exist between HashMap and Hashtable?","answer":"There are several differences between HashMap and Hashtable in Java:\n\nHashtable is synchronized, whereas HashMap is not. This makes HashMap better for non-threaded applications, as unsynchronized Objects typically perform better than synchronized ones.\n\n\nHashtable does not allow null keys or values.  HashMap allows one null key and any number of null values.\n\n\nOne of HashMap's subclasses is LinkedHashMap, so in the event that you'd want predictable iteration order (which is insertion order by default), you could easily swap out the HashMap for a LinkedHashMap.  This wouldn't be as easy if you were using Hashtable."},{"question":"What is the purpose Class.forName method?","answer":"This method is used to method is used to load the driver that will establish a connection to the database."},{"question":"What is JDBC?","answer":"JDBC is an abstraction layer that allows users to choose between databases. JDBC enables developers to write database applications in Java, without having to concern themselves with the underlying details of a particular database."},{"question":"What is the design pattern that Java uses for all Swing components?","answer":"The design pattern used by Java for all Swing components is the Model View Controller (MVC) pattern."},{"question":"How does Garbage Collection prevent a Java application from going out of memory?","answer":"It doesn\u2019t! Garbage Collection simply cleans up unused memory when an object goes out of scope and is no longer needed. However an application could create a huge number of large objects that causes an OutOfMemoryError."},{"question":"What do you know about the big-O notation and can you give some examples with respect to different data structures?","answer":"The Big-O notation simply describes how well an algorithm scales or performs in the worst case scenario as the number of elements in a data structure increases. The Big-O notation can also be used to describe other behavior such as memory consumption. Since the collection classes are actually data structures, we usually use the Big-O notation to chose the best implementation to use, based on time, memory and performance. Big-O notation can give a good indication about performance for large amounts of data."},{"question":"What are the Data Types supported by Java? What is Autoboxing and Unboxing?","answer":"The eight primitive data types supported by the Java programming language are:\nbyte\nshort\nint\nlong\nfloat\ndouble\nboolean\nchar\nAutoboxing is the automatic conversion made by the Java compiler between the primitive types and their corresponding object wrapper classes. If the conversion goes the other way, this operation is called unboxing."},{"question":"What is an Java Applet?","answer":"A Java Applet is program that can be included in a HTML page and be executed in a java enabled client browser. Applets are used for creating dynamic and interactive web applications."},{"question":"What will happen to the Exception object after exception handling?","answer":"The Exception object will be garbage collected in the next garbage collection."},{"question":"What is the importance of finally block in exception handling?","answer":"A finally block will always be executed, whether or not an exception is actually thrown. Even in the case where the catch statement is missing and an exception is thrown, the finally block will still be executed. Last thing to mention is that the finally block is used to release resources like I\/O buffers, database connections, etc."},{"question":"What is the purpose of garbage collection in Java, and when is it used?","answer":"The purpose of garbage collection is to identify and discard those objects that are no longer needed by the application, in order for the resources to be reclaimed and reused."},{"question":"What does System.gc() and Runtime.gc() methods do?","answer":"These methods can be used as a hint to the JVM, in order to start a garbage collection. However, this it is up to the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) to start the garbage collection immediately or later in time."},{"question":"What is the difference between Exception and Error in java?","answer":"An Error \"indicates serious problems that a reasonable application should not try to catch.\"\nAn Exception \"indicates conditions that a reasonable application might want to catch.\""},{"question":"What is reflection and why is it useful?","answer":"The name reflection is used to describe code which is able to inspect other code in the same system (or itself) and to make modifications at runtime.For example, say you have an object of an unknown type in Java, and you would like to call a 'doSomething' method on it if one exists. Java's static typing system isn't really designed to support this unless the object conforms to a known interface, but using reflection, your code can look at the object and find out if it has a method called 'doSomething' and then call it if you want to.java\nMethod method = foo.getClass().getMethod(\"doSomething\", null);\nmethod.invoke(foo, null);"},{"question":"When does an Object becomes eligible for Garbage collection in Java ?","answer":"A Java object is subject to garbage collection when it becomes unreachable to the program in which it is currently used.[\u2b06] JavaScript Interview Questions"},{"question":"What is Coercion in JavaScript?","answer":"In JavaScript conversion between different two build-in types called coercion.  Coercion comes in two forms in JavaScript: explicit and implicit.Here's an example of explicit coercion:\n```js\nvar a = \"42\";var b = Number( a );a;              \/\/ \"42\"\nb;              \/\/ 42 -- the number!\nAnd here's an example of implicit coercion:js\nvar a = \"42\";var b = a * 1;  \/\/ \"42\" implicitly coerced to 42 herea;              \/\/ \"42\"\nb;              \/\/ 42 -- the number!\n```"},{"question":"Explain equality in JavaScript","answer":"JavaScript has both strict and type\u2013converting comparisons: \n* Strict comparison (e.g., ===) checks for value equality without allowing coercion\n* Abstract comparison (e.g. ==) checks for value equality with coercion allowed```js\nvar a = \"42\";\nvar b = 42;a == b;         \/\/ true\na === b;        \/\/ false\n``\nSome simple equalityrules:\n* If either value (aka side) in a comparison could be thetrueorfalsevalue, avoid==and use===.\n* If either value in a comparison could be of these specific values (0,\"\", or[]-- empty array), avoid==and use===.\n* In all other cases, you're safe to use==`. Not only is it safe, but in many cases it simplifies your code in a way that improves readability."},{"question":"What is typeof operator?","answer":"JavaScript provides a typeof operator that can examine a value and tell you what type it is:\n```js\nvar a;\ntypeof a;               \/\/ \"undefined\"a = \"hello world\";\ntypeof a;               \/\/ \"string\"a = 42;\ntypeof a;               \/\/ \"number\"a = true;\ntypeof a;               \/\/ \"boolean\"a = null;\ntypeof a;               \/\/ \"object\" -- weird, buga = undefined;\ntypeof a;               \/\/ \"undefined\"a = { b: \"c\" };\ntypeof a;               \/\/ \"object\"\n```"},{"question":"What is the object type?","answer":"The object type refers to a compound value where you can set properties (named locations) that each hold their own values of any type. ```js\nvar obj = {\n    a: \"hello world\", \/\/ property\n    b: 42,\n    c: true\n};obj.a;      \/\/ \"hello world\", accessed with doted notation\nobj.b;      \/\/ 42\nobj.c;      \/\/ trueobj[\"a\"];   \/\/ \"hello world\", accessed with bracket notation\nobj[\"b\"];   \/\/ 42\nobj[\"c\"];   \/\/ true\nBracket notation is also useful if you want to access a property\/key but the name is stored in another variable, such as:js\nvar obj = {\n    a: \"hello world\",\n    b: 42\n};var b = \"a\";obj[b];         \/\/ \"hello world\"\nobj[\"b\"];       \/\/ 42\n```"},{"question":"Explain arrays in JavaScript","answer":"An array is an object that holds values (of any type) not particularly in named properties\/keys, but rather in numerically indexed positions:```js\nvar arr = [\n    \"hello world\",\n    42,\n    true\n];arr[0];         \/\/ \"hello world\"\narr[1];         \/\/ 42\narr[2];         \/\/ true\narr.length;     \/\/ 3typeof arr;     \/\/ \"object\"\n```"},{"question":"What is Scope in JavaScript?","answer":"In JavaScript, each function gets its own scope. Scope is basically a collection of variables as well as the rules for how those variables are accessed by name.

If one scope is nested inside another, code inside the innermost scope can access variables from either scope."},{"question":"What does \"use strict\" do?","answer":"The use strict literal is entered at the top of a JavaScript program or at the top of a function and it helps you write safer JavaScript code by throwing an error if a global variable is created by mistake. For example, the following program will throw an error:js\nfunction doSomething(val) {\n  \"use strict\"; \n  x = val + 10;\n}`It will throw an error because x was not defined and it is being set to some value in the global scope, which isn't allowed with use strict The small change below fixes the error being thrown:js\nfunction doSomething(val) {\n  \"use strict\"; \n  var x = val + 10;\n}"},{"question":"Explain Null and Undefined in JavaScript","answer":"JavaScript (and by extension TypeScript) has two bottom types: null and undefined.

Does this event have disadvantages? Do you know any alternatives, and why would you use those?","answer":"The load event fires at the end of the document loading process. At this point, all of the objects in the document are in the DOM, and all the images, scripts, links and sub-frames have finished loading.The DOM event DOMContentLoaded will fire after the DOM for the page has been constructed, but do not wait for other resources to finish loading.

There's a ramp up cost involved for your team if you use it for your projects.\nSmaller community (depends on the language), which means resources, tutorials, libraries, and tooling would be harder to find.\nIDE\/editor support might be lacking.\nThese languages will always be behind the latest JavaScript standard.\nDevelopers should be cognizant of what their code is being compiled to\u200a\u2014\u200abecause that is what would actually be running, and that is what matters in the end.\nPractically, ES2015 has vastly improved JavaScript and made it much nicer to write. I don't really see the need for CoffeeScript these days."},{"question":"What language constructions do you use for iterating over object properties and array items?","answer":"For objects:\nfor loops - for (var property in obj) { console.log(property); }. However, this will also iterate through its inherited properties, and you will add an obj.hasOwnProperty(property) check before using it.\nObject.keys() - Object.keys(obj).forEach(function (property) { ... }). Object.keys() is a static method that will lists all enumerable properties of the object that you pass it.\nObject.getOwnPropertyNames() - Object.getOwnPropertyNames(obj).forEach(function (property) { ... }). Object.getOwnPropertyNames() is a static method that will lists all enumerable and non-enumerable properties of the object that you pass it.\nFor arrays:\nfor loops - for (var i = 0; i < arr.length; i++). The common pitfall here is that var is in the function scope and not the block scope and most of the time you would want block scoped iterator variable. ES2015 introduces let which has block scope and it is recommended to use that instead. So this becomes: for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++).\nforEach - arr.forEach(function (el, index) { ... }). This construct can be more convenient at times because you do not have to use the index if all you need is the array elements. There are also the every and some methods which will allow you to terminate the iteration early.\nMost of the time, I would prefer the .forEach method, but it really depends on what you are trying to do. for loops allow more flexibility, such as prematurely terminate the loop using break or incrementing the iterator more than once per loop."},{"question":"What is let keyword in JavaScript?","answer":"In addition to creating declarations for variables at the function level, ES6 lets you declare variables to belong to individual blocks (pairs of { .. }), using the let keyword."},{"question":"Explain what a callback function is and provide a simple example.","answer":"A callback function is a function that is passed to another function as an argument and is executed after some operation has been completed.

They\u00a0can be application-generated or system-generated. Application-generated messages are sent by queued messaging applications."},{"question":"Why do we use MSMQ?","answer":"Microsoft Message Queuing, or MSMQ, is technology for asynchronous messaging. Whenever there's need for two or more applications (processes) to send messages to each other without having to immediately know results, MSMQ can be used. MSMQ can communicate between remote machines, even over Internet. It's free and comes with Windows, but is not installed by default.This mainly addresses the common use case of asynchronous message processing: you have a service Service1 that communicates (send messages) with another part of your software architecture, say Service2.Main problem: what if Service2 becomes suddenly unavailable? Will messages be lost?\nIf you use MSMQ it won't: Service1 will send messages into a queue, and Service2 will dequeue when it is available.MSMQ will resolve following common issues:\ntemporary unavailability of a service: messages are persisted on the disk and will be dequeued when the service becomes available again, so no messages are lost\nas it's fully asynchronous, it'll help a lot in case of punctual peak load: your Service2 won't die under the heavy load, it'll just dequeue and process messages, one after one"},{"question":"What is Queue in MSMQ?","answer":"The queue is just a container that stores messages, decoupling the sender from the receiver. MSMQ Queues are not necessarily FIFO (First In, First Out), because messages can be prioritized.Queues can be transactional or nontransactional. \n* Transactional Queues can only receive  messages sent within a transactional context. \n* Nontransactional queues can only receive messages sent outside of a transactional context. Messages sent in a transactional context are processed in the order in which they were sent.[\u2b06] Machine Learning Interview Questions"},{"question":"What is Machine Learning?","answer":"Machine learning is the study of algorithms and mathematical models that computer systems use to progressively improve their performance on a specific task.

This is called binary classification.Multi-label classification captures everything else, and is useful for customer segmentation, audio and image categorization, and text analysis for mining customer sentiment. If these are the questions you\u2019re hoping to answer with machine learning in your business, consider algorithms like naive Bayes, decision trees, logistic regression, kernel approximation, and K-nearest neighbors.RegressionOn the other hand, regression is useful for predicting outputs that are continuous. That means the answer to your question is represented by a quantity that can be flexibly determined based on the inputs of the model rather than being confined to a set of possible labels. Regression problems with time-ordered inputs are called time-series forecasting problems, like ARIMA forecasting, which allows data scientists to explain seasonal patterns in sales, evaluate the impact of new marketing campaigns, and more.Linear regression is by far the most popular example of a regression algorithm. Though it\u2019s often underrated because of its relative simplicity, it\u2019s a versatile method that can be used to predict housing prices, likelihood of customers to churn, or the revenue a customer will generate. For use cases like these, regression trees and support vector regression are good algorithms to consider if you\u2019re looking for something more sophisticated than linear regression."},{"question":"What is Overfitting in Machine Learning?","answer":"Overfitting in Machine Learning is defined as when a statistical model describes random error or noise instead of underlying relationship or when a model is excessively complex."},{"question":"What s Classification in Machine Learning?","answer":"In machine learning and statistics, classification is the problem of identifying to which of a set of categories (sub-populations) a new observation belongs, on the basis of a training set of data containing observations (or instances) whose category membership is known. Examples are assigning a given email to the \"spam\" or \"non-spam\" class, and assigning a diagnosis to a given patient based on observed characteristics of the patient (sex, blood pressure, presence or absence of certain symptoms, etc.). Classification is an example of pattern recognition.In the terminology of machine learning, classification is considered an instance of supervised learning, i.e., learning where a training set of correctly identified observations is available. The corresponding unsupervised procedure is known as clustering, and involves grouping data into categories based on some measure of inherent similarity or distance."},{"question":"What is Regression Analysis?","answer":"In statistical modeling, regression analysis is a set of statistical processes for estimating the relationships among variables. It includes many techniques for modeling and analyzing several variables, when the focus is on the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables (or 'predictors'). More specifically, regression analysis helps one understand how the typical value of the dependent variable (or 'criterion variable') changes when any one of the independent variables is varied, while the other independent variables are held fixed."},{"question":"What is the difference between supervised and unsupervised machine learning?","answer":"Supervised learning is a process where it requires training labeled data While Unsupervised learning it doesn\u2019t require data labeling."},{"question":"What is the function of Unsupervised Learning?","answer":"The function of Unsupervised Learning are as below:\n* Find clusters of the data\n* Find low-dimensional representations of the data\n* Find interesting directions in data\n* Find interesting coordinates and correlations\n* Find novel observations"},{"question":"What is the function of Supervised Learning?","answer":"The function of Supervised Learning are as below:\n* Classifications\n* Speech recognition\n* Regression\n* Predict time series\n* Annotate strings"},{"question":"What are the disadvantages of neural networks?","answer":"Neural Network requires a large amount of training data to converge.

However, this can be addressed by ensemble methods like random forests or boosted trees."},{"question":"Explain the difference between Supervised Learning and Unsupervised Learning?","answer":"Supervised machine learning is the more commonly used between the two. It includes such algorithms as linear and logistic regression, multi-class classification, and support vector machines. Supervised learning is so named because the data scientist acts as a guide to teach the algorithm what conclusions it should come up with. It\u2019s similar to the way a child might learn arithmetic from a teacher. Supervised learning requires that the algorithm\u2019s possible outputs are already known and that the data used to train the algorithm is already labeled with correct answers. For example, a classification algorithm will learn to identify animals after being trained on a dataset of images that are properly labeled with the species of the animal and some identifying characteristics.On the other hand, unsupervised machine learning is more closely aligned with what some call true artificial intelligence \u2014 the idea that a computer can learn to identify complex processes and patterns without a human to provide guidance along the way. Although unsupervised learning is prohibitively complex for some simpler enterprise use cases, it opens the doors to solving problems that humans normally would not tackle. Some examples of unsupervised machine learning algorithms include k-means clustering, principal and independent component analysis, and association rules.While a supervised classification algorithm learns to ascribe inputted labels to images of animals, its unsupervised counterpart will look at inherent similarities between the images and separate them into groups accordingly, assigning its own new label to each group. In a practical example, this type of algorithm is useful for customer segmentation because it will return groups based on parameters that a human may not consider due to pre-existing biases about the company\u2019s demographic.Choosing to use either a supervised or unsupervised machine learning algorithm typically depends on factors related to the structure and volume of your data and the use case of the issue at hand. A well-rounded data science program will use both types of algorithms to build predictive data models that help stakeholders make decisions across a variety of business challenges."},{"question":"What are the conditions when Overfitting happens?","answer":"One of the important reason and possibility of overfitting is because the criteria used for training the model is not the same as the criteria used to judge the efficacy of a model."},{"question":"How can you avoid overfitting?","answer":"We can avoid overfitting by using:\n* Lots of data\n* Cross-validation"},{"question":"What are the five popular algorithms for Machine Learning?","answer":"Below is the list of five popular algorithms of Machine Learning:\n* Decision Trees\n* Probabilistic networks\n* Nearest Neighbor\n* Support vector machines\n* Neural Networks"},{"question":"What are the different use cases where machine learning algorithms can be used?","answer":"The different use cases where machine learning algorithms can be used are as follows:\n* Fraud Detection\n* Face detection\n* Natural language processing\n* Market Segmentation\n* Text Categorization\n* Bioinformatics"},{"question":"What are parametric models and Non-Parametric models?","answer":"Parametric models are those with a finite number of parameters and to predict new data, you only need to know the parameters of the model.\nNon Parametric models are those with an unbounded number of parameters, allowing for more flexibility and to predict new data, you need to know the parameters of the model and the state of the data that has been observed."},{"question":"What are the three stages to build the hypotheses or model in machine learning?","answer":"The three stages to build the hypotheses or model in machine learning are:\n1.

An object is created in the program to represent a class. Therefore, an object encapsulates all the features, such as data and behavior that are associated to a class. OOP allows developers to develop modular programs and assemble them as software. Objects are used to access data and behaviors of different software modules, such as classes, namespaces, and sharable assemblies. .NET Framework supports only OOP languages, such as Visual Basic .NET, Visual C#, and Visual C++."},{"question":"What is inheritance?","answer":"Inheritance allows us to define a class in terms of another class, which makes it easier to create and maintain an application. This also provides an opportunity to reuse the code functionality and speeds up implementation time.When creating a class, instead of writing completely new data members and member functions, the programmer can designate that the new class should inherit the members of an existing class. This existing class is called the base class, and the new class is referred to as the derived class.The idea of inheritance implements the IS-A relationship. For example, mammal IS A animal, dog IS-A mammal hence dog IS-A animal as well, and so on."},{"question":"What is the difference between procedural and object-oriented programming?","answer":"Procedural programming is based upon the modular approach in which the larger programs are broken into procedures. Each procedure is a set of instructions that are executed one after another. On the other hand, OOP is based upon objects. An object consists of various elements, such as methods and variables.  Access modifiers are not used in procedural programming, which implies that the entire data can be accessed freely anywhere in the program. In OOP, you can specify the scope of a particular data by using access modifiers - public, private, internal, protected, and protected internal."},{"question":"What is encapsulation?","answer":"Encapsulation is defined as the process of enclosing one or more items within a physical or logical package.

It is a comprehensive data type, which represents a blue print of objects. It is a template of object. A class can be defined as the primary building block of OOP. It also serves as a template that describes the properties, state, and behaviors common to a particular group of objects.A class contains data and behavior of an entity. For example, the aircraft class can contain data, such as model number, category, and color and behavior, such as duration of flight, speed, and number of passengers. A class inherits the data members and behaviors of other classes by extending from them."},{"question":"What is the relationship between a class and an object?","answer":"A class acts as a blue-print that defines the properties, states, and behaviors that are common to a number of objects. An object is an instance of the class. For example, you have a class called Vehicle and Car is the object of that class. You can create any number of objects for the class named Vehicle, such as Van, Truck, and Auto.  The new operator is used to create an object of a class. When an object of a class is instantiated, the system allocates memory for every data member that is present in the class."},{"question":"What is an object?","answer":"Objeects are instance of classes.

Thereafter, PHP will start using the original values from php.ini."},{"question":"What are the keys & values in an indexed array?","answer":"Consider:\nphp\nArray ( [0] => Hello [1] => world [2] => It's [3] => a [4] => beautiful [5] => day)The keys of an indexed array are 0, 1, 2 etc. (the index values) and values are \"Hello\", \"world\", \"It's\", \"beautiful\", \"day\"."},{"question":"What is the difference between == and ===?","answer":"The operator == casts between two different types if they are different\nThe === operator performs a 'typesafe comparison'\nThat means that it will only return true if both operands have the same type and the same value.php\n1 === 1: true\n1 == 1: true\n1 === \"1\": false \/\/ 1 is an integer, \"1\" is a string\n1 == \"1\": true \/\/ \"1\" gets casted to an integer, which is 1\n\"foo\" === \"foo\": true \/\/ both operands are strings and have the same value"},{"question":"How can you enable error reporting in PHP?","answer":"Check if \u201cdisplay_errors\u201d is equal \u201con\u201d in the php.ini or declare \u201cini_set('display_errors', 1)\u201d in your script.Then, include \u201cerror_reporting(E_ALL)\u201d in your code to display all types of error messages during the script execution."},{"question":"What are the main differences between const vs define","answer":"The fundamental difference between const vs define is that const defines constants at compile time, whereas define defines them at run time.```php\nconst FOO = 'BAR';\ndefine('FOO', 'BAR');\/\/ but\nif (...) {\n    const FOO = 'BAR';    \/\/ Invalid\n}\nif (...) {\n    define('FOO', 'BAR'); \/\/ Valid\n}\n```Also until PHP 5.3, const could not be used in the global scope. You could only use this from within a class. This should be used when you want to set some kind of constant option or setting that pertains to that class. Or maybe you want to create some kind of enum. An example of good const usage is to get rid of magic numbers. Define can be used for the same purpose, but it can only be used in the global scope. It should only be used for global settings that affect the entire application.Unless you need any type of conditional or expressional definition, use consts instead of define()- simply for the sake of readability!"},{"question":"What are the differences between die() and exit() functions in PHP?","answer":"There's no difference - they are the same. The only advantage of choosing die() over exit(), might be the time you spare on typing an extra letter."},{"question":"What does the 'var' keyword mean in PHP?","answer":"It's for declaring class member variables in PHP4, and is no longer needed. It will work in PHP5, but will raise an E_STRICT warning in PHP from version 5.0.0 up to version 5.1.2, as of when it was deprecated. Since PHP 5.3, var has been un-deprecated and is a synonym for 'public'.Consider:\nphp\nclass foo {\n    var $x = 'y'; \/\/ or you can use public like...\n    public $x = 'y'; \/\/this is also a class member variables.\n    function bar() {\n    }\n}"},{"question":"What's the difference between isset() and array_key_exists()?","answer":"array_key_exists will tell you if a key exists in an array and complains when $a does not exist.\nisset will only return true if the key\/variable exists and is not null. isset doesn't complain when $a does not exist.\nConsider:\n```js\n$a = array('key1' => 'Foo Bar', 'key2' => null);isset($a['key1']);             \/\/ true\narray_key_exists('key1', $a);  \/\/ trueisset($a['key2']);             \/\/ false\narray_key_exists('key2', $a);  \/\/ true\n```"},{"question":"What are the different scopes of variables?","answer":"Variable scope is known as its boundary within which it can be visible or accessed from code. In other words, it is the context within which a variable is defined. There are only two scopes available in PHP namely local and global scopes.\nLocal variables (local scope)\nGlobal variables (special global scope)\nStatic variables (local scope)\nFunction parameters (local scope)\nWhen a variable is accessed outside its scope it will cause PHP error undefined variable."},{"question":"What is the difference between single-quoted and double-quoted strings in PHP?","answer":"Single quoted strings will display things almost completely \"as is.\" \nDouble quote strings will display a host of escaped characters (including some regexes), and variables in the strings will be evaluated.\nThings get evaluated in double quotes but not in single:php\n$s = \"dollars\";\necho 'This costs a lot of $s.'; \/\/ This costs a lot of $s.\necho \"This costs a lot of $s.\"; \/\/ This costs a lot of dollars."},{"question":"What do we mean by keys and values?","answer":"In associative arrays, we can use named keys that you assign to them.\nThere are two ways to create an associative array: ```php\n\/\/ first way -$age = array(\"Peter\"=>\"35\", \"Ben\"=>\"37\", \"Joe\"=>\"43\");`\/\/ another method - \n$age['Peter'] = \"35\"; \/\/Peter, Ben & Joe are keys\n$age['Ben'] = \"37\"; \/\/35, 37 & 43 are values\n$age['Joe'] = \"43\";\n```"},{"question":"PHP array delete by value (not key)","answer":"Details:\nI have a PHP array as follows:php\n$messages = [312, 401, 1599, 3, ...];I want to delete the element containing the value $del_val (for example, $del_val=401), but I don't know its key. This might help: each value can only be there once.I'm looking for the simplest function to perform this task please.Using array_search() and unset, try the following:js\nif (($key = array_search($del_val, $messages)) !== false) {\n   unset($messages[$key]);\n}array_search() returns the key of the element it finds, which can be used to remove that element from the original array using unset(). It will return FALSE on failure, however it can return a false-y value on success (your key may be 0 for example), which is why the strict comparison !== operator is used.The if() statement will check whether array_search() returned a value, and will only perform an action if it did."},{"question":"When should I use require vs. include?","answer":"The require() function is identical to include(), except that it handles errors differently. If an error occurs, the include() function generates a warning, but the script will continue execution. The require() generates a fatal error, and the script will stop.My suggestion is to just use require_once 99.9% of the time.Using require or include instead implies that your code is not reusable elsewhere, i.e. that the scripts you're pulling in actually execute code instead of making available a class or some function libraries."},{"question":"What is the difference between var_dump() and print_r()?","answer":"The var_dump function displays structured information about variables\/expressions including its type and value. Arrays are explored recursively with values indented to show structure. It also shows which array values and object properties are references.\n\n\nThe print_r() displays information about a variable in a way that's readable by humans. array values will be presented in a format that shows keys and elements. Similar notation is used for objects.\n\nConsider:\nphp\n$obj = (object) array('qualitypoint', 'technologies', 'India');\nvar_dump($obj)will display below output in the screen:\nobject(stdClass)#1 (3) {\n [0]=> string(12) \"qualitypoint\"\n [1]=> string(12) \"technologies\"\n [2]=> string(5) \"India\"\n}\nAnd, print_r($obj) will display below output in the screen.\nstdClass Object ( \n [0] => qualitypoint\n [1] => technologies\n [2] => India\n)"},{"question":"Is there a difference between isset and !empty?","answer":"empty is more or less shorthand for!isset($foo) || !$foo, and !empty is analogous to isset($foo) && $foo.  empty is the same as !$foo, but doesn't throw warnings if the variable doesn't exist. That's the main point of this function: do a boolean comparison without worrying about the variable being set."},{"question":"Explain what the different PHP errors are","answer":"A notice is a non-critical error saying something went wrong in execution, something minor like an undefined variable.\nA warning is given when a more critical error like if an include() command went to retrieve a non-existent file. In both this and the error above, the script would continue.\nA fatal error would terminate the code. Failure to satisfy a require() would generate this type of error, for example."},{"question":"Differentiate between echo and print()","answer":"echo and print are more or less the same. They are both used to output data to the screen.The differences are: \n- echo has no return value while print has a return value of 1 so it can be used in expressions. \n- echo can take multiple parameters (although such usage is rare) while print can take one argument. \n- echo is faster than print."},{"question":"Give me some real life examples when you had to use __destruct in your classes","answer":"We know that __destruct is called when the object is destroyed. Logically, what happens if the object is destroyed? Well, it means it's no longer available. So if it has resources open, it makes sense to close those resources as it's being destroyed or cleaning up after itself. Also because PHP will close resources on termination for you doesn't mean that it's bad to explicitly close them when you no longer need them (or good to not close them).Some real examples are:\n* Closing custom database connector\/wrapper connection\n* Deletion of temporary folders\n* Cleaning up caching\n* Spooling the queue of logging messages to db\/file"},{"question":"Declare some function with default parameter","answer":"Consider:\nphp\nfunction showMessage($hello = false){\n  echo ($hello) ?

An example of a PSR is PSR-2, which is a coding style guide."},{"question":"Explain how we handle exceptions in PHP?","answer":"When an exception is thrown, code following the statement will not be executed, and PHP will attempt to find the first matching catch block. If an exception is not caught, a PHP Fatal Error will be issued with an \"Uncaught Exception\".\nAn exception can be thrown, and caught within PHP. To handle exceptions, code may be surrounded in a try block.\nEach try must have at least one corresponding catch block. Multiple catch blocks can be used to catch different classes of exceptions.\nExceptions can be thrown (or re-thrown) within a catch block.Consider:php\ntry {\n    print \"this is our try block n\";\n    throw new Exception();\n} catch (Exception $e) {\n    print \"something went wrong, caught yah! n\";\n} finally {\n    print \"this part is always executed n\";\n}"},{"question":"Is multiple inheritance supported in PHP?","answer":"PHP supports only single inheritance; it means that a class can be extended from only one single class using the keyword 'extended'."},{"question":"How is it possible to set an infinite execution time for PHP script?","answer":"The set_time_limit(0)added at the beginning of a script sets to infinite the time of execution to not have the PHP error 'maximum execution time exceeded.' It is also possible to specify this in the php.ini file."},{"question":"What is stdClass in PHP?","answer":"stdClass is just a generic 'empty' class that's used when casting other types to objects. stdClass is not the base class for objects in PHP.  This can be demonstrated fairly easily:js\nclass Foo{}\n$foo = new Foo();\necho ($foo instanceof stdClass)?'Y':'N'; \/\/ outputs 'N'It is useful for anonymous objects, dynamic properties, etc. An easy way to consider the StdClass is as an alternative to associative array. See this example below that shows how json_decode() allows to get an StdClass instance or an associative array.\nAlso but not shown in this example, SoapClient::__soapCall returns an StdClass instance.```js\n\/\/Example with StdClass\n$json = '{ \"foo\": \"bar\", \"number\": 42 }';\n$stdInstance = json_decode($json);echo $stdInstance - > foo.PHP_EOL; \/\/\"bar\"\necho $stdInstance - > number.PHP_EOL; \/\/42\/\/Example with associative array\n$array = json_decode($json, true);echo $array['foo'].PHP_EOL; \/\/\"bar\"\necho $array['number'].PHP_EOL; \/\/42\n```"},{"question":"In PHP, objects are they passed by value or by reference?","answer":"In PHP, objects passed by value."},{"question":"Explain usage of enumerations in PHP","answer":"PHP doesn't have native Enumerations. Depending upon use case, I would normally use something simple like the following:```php\nabstract class DaysOfWeek\n{\n    const Sunday = 0;\n    const Monday = 1;\n    \/\/ etc.\n}$today = DaysOfWeek::Sunday;\n```There is a native extension, too. SplEnum gives the ability to emulate and create enumeration objects natively in PHP."},{"question":"What is the differences between $a != $b and $a !== $b?","answer":"!= means inequality (TRUE if $a is not equal to $b) and !== means non-identity (TRUE if $a is not identical to $b)."},{"question":"What is PDO in PHP?","answer":"PDO stands for PHP Data Object.It is a set of PHP extensions that provide a core PDO class and database, specific drivers. It provides a vendor-neutral, lightweight, data-access abstraction layer. Thus, no matter what database we use, the function to issue queries and fetch data will be same. It focuses on data access abstraction rather than database abstraction."},{"question":"Can you extend a Final defined class?","answer":"No, you cannot extend a Final defined class. A Final class or method declaration prevents child class or method overriding.[\u2b06] PWA Interview Questions"},{"question":"What is a progressive web app?","answer":"The concept of the progressive web app (PWA) was approached by Google in late 2015. They are basically web applications (Website) but have look and feel like other native mobile apps. The progressive web app enabled websites can offer functionalities such as working offline, push notifications, and device hardware access."},{"question":"Why do we need a web manifest for PWA?","answer":"A web manifest file lists all the information about the website in a JSON format. Having this file is one of the requirements to make the website installable.It usually resides in the root folder of a web app. It contains useful information, such as the app\u2019s title, paths to different-sized icons that can be used to represent the app on a mobile OS (for example, as the home screen icon), and a background color to use in loading or splash screens. This information is needed for the browser to present the web app properly when installing, and on the home screen."},{"question":"What makes an app a PWA?","answer":"There are some key principles a web app should try to observe to be identified as a PWA. It should be:\nDiscoverable, so the contents can be found through search engines.\nInstallable, so it's available on the device's home screen.\nLinkable, so you can share it by simply sending a URL. \n*** Network independent**, so it works offline or with a poor network connection.\nProgressive, so it's still usable on a basic level on older browsers, but fully-functional on the latest ones.\nRe-engageable, so it's able to send notifications whenever there's new content available.\nResponsive, so it's usable on any device with a screen and a browser \u2014 mobile phones, tablets, laptops, TVs, fridges, etc.\nSafe, so the connection between you and the app is secured against any third parties trying to get access to your sensitive data."},{"question":"What are some benefits of PWA?","answer":"Benefits of the progressive web app:\nSmaller and Faster:\nThe progressive web apps are much smaller in size than native apps. They don\u2019t even need to install. That\u2019s they are not wasting disc space and load very fast.\nResponsive Interface:\nProgressive web app (PWA) supported web pages are capable to fit in every screen sizes automatically. It could be a smartphone, tablet, desktop or laptop.\nNo Updates Required:\nMost of the mobile apps need regular weekly updates. Like the normal website, progressive web apps (PWA) are always loaded latest updated version whenever the user interaction happens and no App or Play Store approval required.\nCost Effective:\nNative mobile apps need to be developed for both Android and iOS devices separately and their development cost is very high. On the other hand, progressive web apps are had the same features but the fraction of the prior price.\nSEO Advantage:\nProgressive web apps are discoverable by search engines and load super-fast. Just like other websites, their links are sharable too. This, in other words, gives good user experience and result in SEO rank boost.\nOffline capabilities:\nDue to the support of service worker API, PWAs are accessible in offline or low internet connections.\nSecurity:\nPWAs are delivered over HTTPS connection and secure user-data over each interaction.\nPush Notifications:\nBy the support of push notifications, PWAs can interact easily with the users and provide a really amazing user experience.\nBypass the  app stores:\nPWAs don\u2019t need the App store or Google play store support. Their updated version can be directly loaded from the web server without the requirement of app store approval. On the other hand, native apps need days of approval if any new update required. There are possibilities of getting rejected or banned.\nZero installation:\nDuring browsing, progressive web app gets its own icon on phones and tablets, just like a mobile application, but without the need to go through the tedious and slow App Store installation process.\n[\u2b06] PowerShell Interview Questions"},{"question":"What is PowerShell?","answer":"PowerShell is a task-based command-line shell and scripting language built on .NET. PowerShell helps system administrators and power-users rapidly automate tasks that manage operating systems (Linux, macOS, and Windows) and processes.The consistency of PowerShell is one of its primary assets. For example, if you learn how to use the Sort-Object cmdlet, you can use that knowledge to sort the output of any cmdlet. You don't have to learn the different sorting routines of each cmdlet. PowerShell combines an interactive shell and a scripting environment. PowerShell can access command-line tools, COM objects, and .NET class libraries. PowerShell is based on object not text. The output of a command is an object. You can send the output object, through the pipeline, to another command as its input."},{"question":"What would be the PowerShell equivalent of echo?","answer":"There are several ways:\nWrite-Host: Write directly to the console, not included in function\/cmdlet output. Allows foreground and background colour to be set.\nWrite-Debug: Write directly to the console, if $DebugPreference set to Continue or Stop.\nWrite-Verbose: Write directly to the console, if $VerbosePreference set to Continue or Stop.\necho as an alias mapping to Write-Output"},{"question":"What is a PowerShell session?","answer":"A session is an environment in which PowerShell runs.Each time you start PowerShell, a session is created for you, and you can run commands in the session. You can also add items to your session, such as modules and snap-ins, and you can create items, such as variables, functions, and aliases. These items exist only in the session and are deleted when the session ends."},{"question":"What is PowerShell execution policies?","answer":"The PowerShell execution policy is the setting that determines which type of PowerShell scripts (if any) can be run on the system. PowerShell's execution policy is a safety feature that controls the conditions under which PowerShell loads configuration files and runs scripts.[\u2b06] Python Interview Questions"},{"question":"Name some characteristics of Python?","answer":"Here are a few key points:\nPython is an interpreted language. That means that, unlike languages like C and its variants, Python does not need to be compiled before it is run. Other interpreted languages include PHP and Ruby.\nPython is dynamically typed, this means that you don't need to state the types of variables when you declare them or anything like that. You can do things like x=111 and then x=\"I'm a string\" without error\nPython is well suited to object orientated programming in that it allows the definition of classes along with composition and inheritance. Python does not have access specifiers (like C++'s public, private), the justification for this point is given as \"we are all adults here\"\nIn Python, functions are first-class objects. This means that they can be assigned to variables, returned from other functions and passed into functions. Classes are also first class objects\nWriting Python code is quick but running it is often slower than compiled languages. Fortunately, Python allows the inclusion of C based extensions so bottlenecks can be optimised away and often are. The numpy package is a good example of this, it's really quite quick because a lot of the number crunching it does isn't actually done by Python"},{"question":"What are the built-in types available In Python?","answer":"Immutable built-in datatypes of Python\n* Numbers\n* Strings\n* TuplesMutable built-in datatypes of Python\n* List\n* Dictionaries\n* Sets"},{"question":"How do I modify a string?","answer":"You can\u2019t, because strings are immutable. In most situations, you should simply construct a new string from the various parts you want to assemble it from."},{"question":"Why would you use the \"pass\" statement?","answer":"Python has the syntactical requirement that code blocks cannot be empty. Empty code blocks are however useful in a variety of different contexts, for example if you are designing a new class with some methods that you don't want to implement:```python\nclass MyClass(object):\n    def meth_a(self):\n        passdef meth_b(self):\n    print \"I'm meth_b\"\nIf you were to leave out the pass, the code wouldn't run and you'll get an error:python\nIndentationError: expected an indented block\n```Other examples when we could use pass:\n* Ignoring (all or) a certain type of Exception\n* Deriving an exception class that does not add new behaviour\n* Testing that code runs properly for a few test values, without caring about the results"},{"question":"What is pickling and unpickling?","answer":"The pickle module implements a fundamental, but powerful algorithm for serializing and de-serializing a Python object structure.\nPickling - is the process whereby a Python object hierarchy is converted into a byte stream,\nUnpickling - is the inverse operation, whereby a byte stream is converted back into an object hierarchy."},{"question":"What is negative index in Python?","answer":"Python sequences can be index in positive and negative numbers. For positive index, 0 is the first index, 1 is the second index and so forth. For negative index, (-1) is the last index and (-2) is the second last index and so forth."},{"question":"Name some benefits of Python","answer":"Python is a dynamic-typed language.

These variables can be accessed by any function in the program.\n\n\nLocal Variables: Any variable declared inside a function is known as a local variable. This variable is present in the local space and not in the global space."},{"question":"What are the rules for local and global variables in Python?","answer":"In Python, variables that are only referenced inside a function are implicitly global. If a variable is assigned a value anywhere within the function\u2019s body, it\u2019s assumed to be a local unless explicitly declared as global.Requiring global for assigned variables provides a bar against unintended side-effects."},{"question":"What is lambda functions in Python?","answer":"A lambda function is a small anonymous function.

CPython (the most common Python implementation) is not fully thread safe. In order to support multi-threaded Python programs, CPython provides a global lock that must be held by the current thread before it can safely access Python objects. As a result, no matter how many threads or processors are present, only one thread is ever being executed at any given time. In comparison, it is worth noting that the PyPy implementation discussed earlier in this article provides a stackless mode that supports micro-threads for massive concurrency.\n- Execution speed. Python can be slower than compiled languages since it is interpreted. (Well, sort of. See our earlier discussion on this topic.)"},{"question":"Does Python have a switch-case statement?","answer":"In Python, we do not have a switch-case statement. Here, you may write a switch function to use. Else, you may use a set of if-elif-else statements.

React\u2019s core purpose is to build UI components; it is often referred to as just the \u201cV\u201d (View) in an \u201cMVC\u201d architecture."},{"question":"How would you write an inline style in React?","answer":"For example: ```html\n```\n\n\n#### What is JEST? \n**Jest** is a JavaScript unit testing framework made by Facebook based on Jasmine and provides automated mock creation and a jsdom environment. It's often used for testing React components.\n\n\n#### What are the advantages of ReactJS? \nBelow are the advantages of ReactJS:\n1. Increases the application\u2019s performance with Virtual DOM\n2. JSX makes code is easy to read and write\n3. It renders both on client and server side\n4. Easy to integrate with other frameworks (Angular, BackboneJS) since it is only a view library\n5. Easy to write UI Test cases and integration with tools such as JEST.\n\n\n#### How to write comments in ReactJS? \nThe comments in ReactJS\/JSX is similar to javascript multiline comments which are wrapped with curly braces:\n\n**Single-line comments:**\n```js\n\n  {\/* Single-line comments *\/}\n  Welcome {user}, Let's play React\n\n```\n\n**Multi-line comments:**\n```js\n\n  {\/* Multi-line comments for more than\n   one line *\/}\n  Welcome {user}, Let's play React\n\n```\n\n\n#### What is context? \n**Context** provides a way to pass data through the component tree without having to pass props down manually at every level. For example, authenticated user, locale preference, UI theme need to be accessed in the application by many components.\n\n```js\nconst {Provider, Consumer} = React.createContext(defaultValue);\n```\n\n\n#### What is virtual DOM? \n**The virtual DOM (VDOM)** is an in-memory representation of Real DOM. The representation of a UI is kept in memory and synced with the \u201creal\u201d DOM. It\u2019s a step that happens between the render function being called and the displaying of elements on the screen. This entire process is called reconciliation.\n\n\n#### How does React work? \nReact creates a virtual DOM. When state changes in a component it firstly runs a \"diffing\" algorithm, which identifies what has changed in the virtual DOM. The second step is reconciliation, where it updates the DOM with the results of diff.\n\n\n#### What is the use of refs? \nThe **ref** is used to return a reference to the element. They should be avoided in most cases, however, they can be useful when we need direct access to DOM element or an instance of a component.\n\n\n#### What is props in ReactJS? \n**Props** are inputs to a React component. They are single values or objects containing a set of values that are passed to React Components on creation using a naming convention similar to HTML-tag attributes. i.e, *They are data passed down from a parent component to a child component.*\n\nThe primary purpose of props in React is to provide following component functionality:\n\n1. Pass custom data to your React component.\n2. Trigger `state` changes.\n3. Use via `this.props.reactProp` inside component's `render()` method.\n\nFor example, let us create an element with reactProp property,\n```js\n \n```\n\nThis `reactProp` (or whatever you came up with) name then becomes a property attached to React's native props object which originally already exists on all components created using React library.\n\n```js\n props.reactProp;\n```\n\n\n#### What are the major features of ReactJS? \nThe major features of ReactJS are as follows,\n\n- It uses **VirtualDOM** instead RealDOM considering that RealDOM manipulations are expensive.\n- Supports **server-side rendering**\n- Follows **Unidirectional** data flow or data binding\n- Uses **reusable\/composable** UI components to develop the view\n\n\n#### What is ReactJS? \nReactJS is an **open-source frontend JavaScript library** which is used for building user interfaces especifically for single page applications. It is used for handling view layer for web and mobile apps. React was created by Jordan Walke, a software engineer working for Facebook. ReactJS was first deployed on Facebook\u2019s newsfeed in 2011 and on Instagram.com in 2012.\n\n\n#### What are props in React? \nProps are properties that are passed into a child component from its parent, and are readonly.\n\n\n#### What is Flux? \nUnidrectional application flow paradigm popular a few years back in React; mostly superceded by Redux these days.\n\n\n#### How error boundaries handled in React (15)? \nReact15 provided very basic support for error boundaries using the method name **unstable_handleError**. Later this has been renamed as **componentDidCatch** starting from React16 beta release.\n\n\n#### What are the limitations of ReactJS? \nBelow are the list of limitations:\n\n1. React is just a view library, not a full-blown framework\n2. There is a learning curve for beginners who are new to web development.\n3. Integrating React.js into a traditional MVC framework requires some additional configuration\n4. The code complexity increases with inline templating and JSX.\n5. Too many smaller components leading to over-engineering or boilerplate\n\n\n#### What\u2019s the difference between an \"Element\" and a \"Component\" in React? \nSimply put, a React element describes what you want to see on the screen. Not so simply put, a React element is an object representation of some UI.\n\nA React component is a function or a class which optionally accepts input and returns a React element (typically via JSX which gets transpiled to a createElement invocation).\n\n\n#### What are stateful components? \nIf the behaviour of a component is dependent on the state of the component then it can be termed as _stateful component_. These Stateful components are always class components and have a state that gets initialized in the constructor.\n\n```js\nclass App extends Component {\n constructor(props) {\n  super(props);\n  this.state = { count: 0 };\n }\n\n render() {\n    \/\/ omitted for brevity\n  }\n}\n```\n\n\n#### What are stateless components? \nIf the behaviour is independent of its state then it can be a _stateless component_. You can use either a function or a class for creating stateless components. But unless you need to use a lifecycle hook in your components, you should go for stateless functional components. There are a lot of benefits if you decide to use stateless functional components here; they are easy to write, understand, and test, and you can avoid the this keyword altogether.\n\n\n#### What are portals in ReactJS? \nPortal is a recommended way to render children into a DOM node that exists outside the DOM hierarchy of the parent component.\n\n```js\nReactDOM.createPortal(child, container);\n```\n\nThe first argument (child) is any renderable React child, such as an element, string, or fragment. The second argument (container) is a DOM element.\n\n\n#### What are fragments? \nIt's common pattern in React which is used for a component to return multiple elements. Fragments let you group a list of children without adding extra nodes to the DOM.\n\n```js\nrender() {\n  return (\n    \n\n\n\n\n  );\n}\n```\n\nThere is also a shorter syntax which is not supported in many tools\n\n```js\nrender() {\n    return (\n      <>\n         \n\n\n      \n    );\n  }\n```\n\n\n#### Why is it necessary to capitalize the components? \nIt is necessary because components are not the DOM element but they are constructors. If they are not capitalized, they can cause various issues and can confuse developers with several elements.\n\n\n#### What is reconciliation? \nWhen a component\u2019s props or state change, React decides whether an actual DOM update is necessary by comparing the newly returned element with the previously rendered one. When they are not equal, React will update the DOM. This process is called **reconciliation**.\n\n\n#### What is the purpose of using super constructor with props argument? \nA child class constructor cannot make use of **this** reference until `super()` method has been called. The same applies for ES6 sub-classes as well. The main reason of passing props parameter to super() call is to access this.props in your child constructors.\n\n**Passing props:**\n```js\nclass MyComponent extends React.Component {\n    constructor(props) {\n        super(props);\n        console.log(this.props);  \/\/ Prints { name: 'sudheer',age: 30 }\n    }\n}\n```\n**Not passing props:**\n```js\nclass MyComponent extends React.Component {\n    constructor(props) {\n        super();\n        console.log(this.props); \/\/ Prints undefined\n        \/\/ But Props parameter is still available\n        console.log(props); \/\/ Prints { name: 'sudheer',age: 30 }\n    }\n\n    render() {\n        \/\/ No difference outside constructor\n        console.log(this.props) \/\/ Prints { name: 'sudheer',age: 30 }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThe above code snippets reveals that this.props behavior is different only with in the constructor. It would be same outside the constructor.\n\n\n#### When to use a Class Component over a Functional Component? \nIf the component need state or lifecycle methods then use class component otherwise use functional component.\n\n\n#### What are the advantages of using React? \n- It is easy to know how a component is rendered, you just need to look at the render function.\n- JSX makes it easy to read the code of your components. It is also really easy to see the layout, or how components are plugged\/combined with each other.\n- You can render React on the server-side. This enables improves SEO and performance.\n- It is easy to test.\n- You can use React with any framework (Backbone.js, Angular.js) as it is only a view layer.\n\n\n#### What are Higher-Order components? \nA higher-order component **(HOC)** is a function that takes a component and returns a new component. Basically, it\u2019s a pattern that is derived from React\u2019s compositional nature\nWe call them as **\u201cpure\u2019 components\u201d**  because they can accept any dynamically provided child component but they won\u2019t modify or copy any behavior from their input components.\n```js\nconst EnhancedComponent = higherOrderComponent(WrappedComponent);\n```\nHOC can be used for many use cases as below,\n\n1. Code reuse, logic and bootstrap abstraction\n2. Render High jacking\n3. State abstraction and manipulation\n4. Props manipulation\n\n\n#### What are controlled components? \nA ReactJS component that controls the input elements within the forms on subsequent user input is called **\u201cControlled component\u201d**. i.e, every state mutation will have an associated handler function.\n\nFor example, to write all the names in uppercase letters, we use handleChange as below,\n\n```js\nhandleChange(event) {\n    this.setState({\n        value: event.target.value.toUpperCase()\n    });\n}\n```\n\n\n#### What is the difference between a Presentational component and a Container component? \n* **Presentational components** are concerned with _how things look_. They generally receive data and callbacks exclusively via props. These components rarely have their own state, but when they do it generally concerns UI state, as opposed to data state.\n\n* **Container components** are more concerned with _how things work_. These components provide the data and behavior to presentational or other container components. They call Flux actions and provide these as callbacks to the presentational components. They are also often stateful as they serve as data sources. \n\n#### How to create refs? \n**Refs** are created using `React.createRef()` method and attached to React elements via the ref attribute. In order to use refs throughout the component, just assign the ref to the instance property with in constructor.\n```js\nclass MyComponent extends React.Component {\n  constructor(props) {\n    super(props);\n    this.myRef = React.createRef();\n  }\n  render() {\n    return ;\n  }\n}\n```\nAnd:\n```js\nclass UserForm extends Component {\n  handleSubmit = () => {\n    console.log(\"Input Value is: \", this.input.value)\n  }\n  render () {\n    return (\n      \n this.input = input} \/> \/\/ Access DOM input in handle submit\n        Submit\n\n    )\n  }\n}\n```\nWe can also use it in functional components with the help of closures.\n\n\n#### What are the differences between a class component and functional component? \n- **Class components** allows you to use additional features such as local state and lifecycle hooks. Also, to enable your component to have direct access to your store and thus holds state.\n\n- When your component just receives props and renders them to the page, this is a **stateless component**, for which a pure function can be used. These are also called dumb components or presentational components.\n\n\n#### How is React different from AngularJS (1.x)? \nFor example, AngularJS (1.x) approaches building an application by extending HTML markup and injecting various constructs (e.g. Directives, Controllers, Services) at runtime. As a result, AngularJS is very opinionated about the greater architecture of your application \u2014 these abstractions are certainly useful in some cases, but they come at the cost of flexibility.\n\nBy contrast, React focuses exclusively on the creation of components, and has few (if any) opinions about an application\u2019s architecture. This allows a developer an incredible amount of flexibility in choosing the architecture they deem \u201cbest\u201d \u2014 though it also places the responsibility of choosing (or building) those parts on the developer.\n\n\n#### What happens during the lifecycle of a React component? \nAt the highest level, React components have lifecycle events that fall into three general categories:\n\n1.  Initialization\n2.  State\/Property Updates\n3.  Destruction\n\n\n\n\n#### What is the difference between state and props? \nThe *state* is a data structure that starts with a default value when a Component mounts. It may be mutated across time, mostly as a result of user events.\n\n*Props* (short for properties) are a Component's configuration. They are received from above and immutable as far as the Component receiving them is concerned. A Component cannot change its props, but it is responsible for putting together the props of its child Components. Props do not have to just be data - callback functions may be passed in as props.\n\n\n#### What is inline conditional expressions? \nYou can use either if statements or ternary expressions which are available from JS to conditionally render expressions. Apart from these approaches, you can also embed any expressions in JSX by wrapping them in curly braces and then followed by JS logical operator(&&).\n```js\nHello!\n   {messages.length > 0 &&\n\n    You have {messages.length} unread messages.\n\n```\n\n\n#### How to pass a parameter to an event handler or callback? \nYou can use an arrow function to wrap around an event handler and pass parameters:\n\n```js\n this.handleClick(id)} \/>\n```\nThis is equivalent to calling .bind as below,\n```js\n\n```\n\n\n#### What is the purpose of callback function as an argument of setState? \nThe callback function is invoked when `setState` finished and the component gets rendered. Since `setState` is **asynchronous** the callback function is used for any post action.\n\n**Note:** It is recommended to use lifecycle method rather this callback function.\n```js\nsetState({name: 'sudheer'}, () => console.log('The name has updated and component re-rendered'));\n```\n\n\n#### What happens when you call \"setState\"? \nThe first thing React will do when setState is called is merge the object you passed into setState into the current state of the component. This will kick off a process called reconciliation. The end goal of reconciliation is to, in the most efficient way possible, update the UI based on this new state.\n\nTo do this, React will construct a new tree of React elements (which you can think of as an object representation of your UI). Once it has this tree, in order to figure out how the UI should change in response to the new state, React will diff this new tree against the previous element tree.\n\nBy doing this, React will then know the exact changes which occurred, and by knowing exactly what changes occurred, will able to minimize its footprint on the UI by only making updates where absolutely necessary.\n\n\n#### What is the difference between state and props? \nBoth **props** and **state** are plain JavaScript objects. While both of them hold information that influences the output of render, they are different in their functionality with respect to component. i.e, \n* Props get passed to the component similar to function parameters \n* state is managed within the component similar to variables declared within a function.\n\n\n#### What is state in ReactJS? \n**State** of a component is an object that holds some information that may change over the lifetime of the component. We should always try to make our state as simple as possible and minimize the number of stateful components.\n\n Let's create user component with message state,\n\n ```js\n class User extends React.Component {\n    constructor(props) {\n       super(props);\n\n       this.state = {\n          message: \"Welcome to React world\",\n       }\n    }\n    render() {\n       return (\n          \n{this.state.message}\n\n       );\n    }\n }\n ```\n\n\n#### What are refs used for in React? \n*Refs* are an escape hatch which allow you to get direct access to a DOM element or an instance of a component. In order to use them you add a ref attribute to your component whose value is a callback function which will receive the underlying DOM element or the mounted instance of the component as its first argument.\n\n```js\nclass UnControlledForm extends Component {\n  handleSubmit = () => {\n    console.log(\"Input Value: \", this.input.value)\n  }\n  render () {\n    return (\n      \n this.input = input} \/>\n        Submit\n\n    )\n  }\n}\n```\nAbove notice that our input field has a ref attribute whose value is a function. That function receives the actual DOM element of input which we then put on the instance in order to have access to it inside of the handleSubmit function.\n\nIt\u2019s often misconstrued that you need to use a class component in order to use refs, but refs can also be used with functional components by leveraging closures in JavaScript.\n\n```js\nfunction CustomForm ({handleSubmit}) {\n  let inputElement\n  return (\n     handleSubmit(inputElement.value)}>\n       inputElement = input} \/>\n      Submit\n\n  )\n}\n```\n\n\n#### When rendering a list what is a key and what is it's purpose? \n*Keys* help React identify which items have changed, are added, or are removed. Keys should be given to the elements inside the array to give the elements a stable identity. The best way to pick a key is to use a string that uniquely identifies a list item among its siblings. \n\n```js\nrender () {\n  return (\n    \n      {this.state.todoItems.map(({task, uid}) => {\n        return {task}\n      })}\n    \n  )\n}\n```\n\nMost often you would use IDs from your data as keys. When you don't have stable IDs for rendered items, you may use the item index as a key as a last resort. It is not recommend to use indexes for keys if the items can reorder, as that would be slow. \n\n\n#### How to create components in ReactJS? \nThere are two possible ways to create ReactJS Components.\n\n1. **Functional components:** This is the simplest way to create ReactJS components. It accepts props as an Object and returns ReactJS elements. We call it as \u201cfunctional\u201d because those are pure JavaScript functions.\n```js\n    function Greeting(props) {\n       return  Hello, {props.message}\u2028\n    }\n```\n\n2. **Class components:** You can also use Es6 class to define component. The above functional component can be written as below,\n```js\n      class Greeting extends React.Component {\n        render() {\n                return Hello, {this.props.message};\n            }\n        }\n```\n\n\n\n#### What is the difference between Element and Component? \nAn **element** is a plain object describing what you want to appear on the screen in terms of the DOM nodes or other components. Elements can contain other elements in their props. Creating a React element is cheap. Once an element is created, it is never mutated.\nThe object representation of React element would be as follows,\n```js\nconst element = React.createElement(\n  'div',\n  {id: 'login-btn'},\n  'Login'\n)\n```\nThe above createElement returns as object as below,\n```js\n{\n  type: 'div',\n  props: {\n    children: 'Login',\n    id: 'login-btn'\n  }\n}\n```\nAnd finally it renders to the DOM using ReactDOM.render as below,\n```js\nLogin\n```\nWhereas a **component** can be declared in several different ways. It can be a class with a render() method. Alternatively, in simple cases, it can be defined as a function. In either case, it takes props as an input, and returns an element tree as the output. JSX transpiled as createElement at the end.\n```js\nfunction Button ({ onLogin }) {\n  return React.createElement(\n    'div',\n    {id: 'login-btn', onClick: onLogin},\n    'Login'\n  )\n}\n```\n\n\n#### What is JSX? \nJSX is a syntax notation for **JavaScript XML**(XML-like syntax extension to ECMAScript). It stands for JavaScript XML. It provides expressiveness of JavaScript along with HTML like template syntax. For example, the below text inside h1 tag return as javascript function to the render function,\n\n```js\n   render(){\n        return(\n         \n Welcome to React world!!\n\n        );\n     }\n```\n\n\n#### Describe how events are handled in React. \nIn order to solve cross browser compatibility issues, your event handlers in React will be passed instances of SyntheticEvent, which is React\u2019s cross-browser wrapper around the browser\u2019s native event. These synthetic events have the same interface as native events you\u2019re used to, except they work identically across all browsers.\n\nWhat\u2019s mildly interesting is that React doesn\u2019t actually attach events to the child nodes themselves. React will listen to all events at the top level using a single event listener. This is good for performance and it also means that React doesn\u2019t need to worry about keeping track of event listeners when updating the DOM.\n\n\n#### Where in a React component should you make an AJAX request? \n`componentDidMount` is where an AJAX request should be made in a React component. \n\nThis method will be executed when the component \u201cmounts\u201d (is added to the DOM) for the first time. This method is only executed once during the component\u2019s life. Importantly, you can\u2019t guarantee the AJAX request will have resolved before the component mounts. If it doesn't, that would mean that you\u2019d be trying to setState on an unmounted component, which would not work. Making your AJAX request in `componentDidMount` will guarantee that there\u2019s a component to update.\n\n\n#### What is the difference between component and container in react Redux? \n**Component** is part of the React API. A Component is a class or function that describes part of a React UI.\n**Container** is an informal term for a React component that is connected to a redux store. Containers receive Redux state updates and dispatch actions, and they usually don't render DOM elements; they delegate rendering to presentational child components.\n\n\n#### Where is the state kept in a React + Redux application? \nIn the store.\n\n\n#### What is the difference between React Native and React? \n* **ReactJS** is a JavaScript library, supporting both front end web and being run on the server, for building user interfaces and web applications.\n\n* **React Native** is a mobile framework that compiles to native app components, allowing you to build native mobile applications (iOS, Android, and Windows) in JavaScript that allows you to use ReactJS to build your components, and implements ReactJS under the hood.\n\n\n#### How do we pass a property from a parent component props to a child component? \nFor example: \n```html\n\n```\n\n\n#### What is the point of Redux? \nApplication state management that is easy to reason about, maintain and manage in an asynchronous web application environment.\n\n\n#### What does it mean for a component to be mounted in React? \nIt has a corresponding element created in the DOM and is connected to that.\n\n\n#### What is Flow? \n**Flow** is a static type checker, designed to find type errors in JavaScript programs, created by Facebook. Flow types can express much more fine-grained distinctions than traditional type systems. For example, Flow helps you catch errors involving null, unlike most type systems.\n\n\n#### What happens when you call setState? \nThe state property is updated in a React component with the object passed into setState, and this is done asynchronously. It tells React that this component and its children need to be re-rendered, but React may not do this immediately (it may batch these state update requests for better performance).\n\n\n#### What's the difference between a controlled component and an uncontrolled one in React? \n* A controlled component has its state completely driven by React,\n* Uncontrolled components can maintain their own internal state. E.g., a textarea's value.\n\n\n#### How would you prevent a component from rendering in React? \n Return `null` from the render method.\n\n\n#### How do you prevent the default behavior in an event callback in React? \nYou call `e.preventDefault();` on the event e passed into the callback."},{"question":"What is Angular Framework?","answer":"Angular is a TypeScript-based open-source front-end platform that make_believe it easy to build web, mobile and screen_background applications.

Components are the most basic UI building block of an Angular app, which form a tree of Angular components. These components are a subset of directives. Unlike directives, components always have a template, and only one component can be instantiated per element in a template. Let's see a simple example of Angular component ```typescript import { Component } from '@angular\/core';@Component ({ selector: 'my-app', template: <div> <h1>{{title}}<\/h1> <div>Learn Angular6 with examples<\/div> <\/div>, })export class AppComponent { title: string = 'Welcome to Angular world'; } ```"},{"question":"What are the differences between Component and Directive?","answer":"IN a poor note, A component(@component) is a directive-with-a-template.

You can define it inline using the template property, or you can define the template in a separate HTML file and link to it in the component metadata using the @Component decorator's templateUrl property. Using inline template with template syntax, ```typescript import { Component } from '@angular\/core';@Component ({ selector: 'my-app', template: ' {{title}} Learn Angular ' })export class AppComponent { title: string = 'Hello World'; } **Using separate template file such as app.component.html**typescript import { Component } from '@angular\/core';@Component ({ selector: 'my-app', templateUrl: 'app\/app.component.html' })export class AppComponent { title: string = 'Hello World'; } ```"},{"question":"What is a module?","answer":"Modules are logical bound in your application and the application is divided into separate modules to separate the functionality of your application.

The imports option is used to import other dependent modules. The BrowserModule is required by default for any web based angular application. 2. The declarations option is used to define components in the respective module. 3. The bootstrap option tells Angular which Component to bootstrap in the application. 4.

Angular CLI(**Command Line Interface**) is a command line interface to scaffold and build angular apps using nodejs style (commonJs) modules. You need to install using below npm command, npm install @angular\/cli@latest ``` Below are the list of few commands, which will come handy while creating angular projects 1. Creating New Project: ng new Generating Components, Directives & Services: ng generate\/g The different types of commands would be, ng generate class my-new-class: add a class to your application ng generate component my-new-component: add a component to your application ng generate directive my-new-directive: add a directive to your application ng generate enum my-new-enum: add an enum to your application ng generate module my-new-module: add a module to your application ng generate pipe my-new-pipe: add a pipe to your application ng generate service my-new-service: add a service to your application Running the Project: ng serve"},{"question":"What is the difference between constructor and ngOnInit?","answer":"The **Constructor** follow a default_on method of the class that is executed when the class is instantiated and ensures proper initialisation of fields in the class and its subclasses. Angular, or better Dependency Injector (DI), analyses the constructor parameters and when it creates a new instance by calling new MyClass() it tries to find providers that match the types of the constructor parameters, resolves them and passes them to the constructor. **ngOnInit** is a life cycle hook called by Angular to indicate that Angular is done creating the component. Mostly we use ngOnInit for all the initialization\/declaration and avoid stuff to work in the constructor. The constructor should only be used to initialize class members but shouldn't do actual \"work\". So you should use constructor() to setup Dependency Injection and not much else. ngOnInit() is better place to \"start\" - it's where\/when components' bindings are resolved. ```typescript export class App implements OnInit{ constructor(private myService: MyService){ \/\/called first time before the ngOnInit() }ngOnInit(){ \/\/called after the constructor and called after the first ngOnChanges() \/\/e.g. http call... } } ```"},{"question":"What is a service?","answer":"A armed_service is used when a common functionality needs to be provided to various modules. Services allow for greater separation of concerns for your application and better modularity by allowing you to extract common functionality out of components. Let's create a repoService which can be used across components,```typescript import { Injectable } from '@angular\/core'; import { Http } from '@angular\/http';@Injectable({ \/\/ The Injectable decorator is required for dependency injection to work \/\/ providedIn option registers the service with a specific NgModule providedIn: 'root', \/\/ This declares the service with the root app (AppModule) }) export class RepoService{ constructor(private http: Http){ }fetchAll(){ return this.http.get('https:\/\/api.github.com\/repositories'); } } ``` The above service uses Http service as a dependency."},{"question":"What is dependency injection in Angular?","answer":"dependency injection (DI), is an important application design pattern in which a class asks for dependencies from external sources rather than creating them itself. Angular comes with its own dependency injection framework for resolving dependencies( services or objects that a class needs to perform its function).So you can have your services depend on other services throughout your application."},{"question":"How live dependence Hierarchy formed?","answer":"Injectors in Angular have rules that can be leveraged to achieve the desired visibility of injectables in your applications. By understanding these rules, you can determine in which NgModule, Component, or Directive you should declare a provider.\nAngular has two injector hierarchies:Module injectorWhen angular starts, it creates a root injector where the services will be registered, these are provided via injectable annotation. All services provided in the ng-model property are called providers (if those modules are not lazy-loaded).Angular recursively goes through all models which are being used in the application and creates instances for provided services in the root injector. If you provide some service in an eagerly-loaded model, the service will be added to the root injector, which makes it available across the whole application.Platform ModuleDuring application bootstrapping angular creates a few more injectors, above the root injector goes the platform injector, this one is created by the platform browser dynamic function inside the main.ts file, and it provides some platform-specific features like DomSanitizer. NullInjector()At the very top, the next parent injector in the hierarchy is the NullInjector().The responsibility of this injector is to throw the error if something tries to find dependencies there, unless you've used @Optional() because ultimately, everything ends at the NullInjector() and it returns an error or, in the case of @Optional(), null.ElementInjectorAngular creates ElementInjector hierarchies implicitly for each DOM element. ElementInjector injector is being created for any tag that matches the angular component, or any tag on which directive is applied, and you can configure it in component and directive annotations inside the provider's property, thus, it creates its own hierarchy likewise the upper one."},{"question":"What is the purpose of async pipe?","answer":"The AsyncPipe subscribes to an observable or promise and returns the latest value it has emitted. When a new respect is emitted, the pipe bull's_eye the component to be checked for changes. Let's take a time observable which continuously updates the view for every 2 seconds with the current time. typescript @Component({ selector: 'async-observable-pipe', template: `<div><code>observable|async<\/code>: Time: {{ time | async }}<\/div>` }) export class AsyncObservablePipeComponent { time: Observable<string>; constructor() { this.time = new Observable((observer) => { setInterval(() => { observer.next(new Date().toString()); }, 2000); }); } }"},{"question":"What equal the option to choose between inline and external template file?","answer":"You can store your component's template in one of two places. You can define it inline using the **template** property, or you can define the template in a separate HTML file and link to it in the component metadata using the **@Component** decorator's **templateUrl** property.\nThe choice between inline and separate HTML is a matter of taste, circumstances, and organization policy. But normally we use inline template for small portion of code and external template file for bigger views. By default, the Angular CLI generates components with a template file. But you can override that with the below command,\nng generate component hero -it"},{"question":"What is the purpose of *ngFor directive?","answer":"We use angulate `*ngFor` guiding in the template to display each item in the list. For example, here we can iterate over a list of users: ```html <li *ngFor=\"let user of users\"> {{ user }} <\/li> ``` The user variable in the `*ngFor` double-quoted instruction is a **template input variable**."},{"question":"What is the purpose of *ngIf directive?","answer":"sometimes AN app needs to display a view or a portion of a view only under specific circumstances. The Angular `*ngIf` directive inserts or removes an element based on a truthy\/falsy condition. Let's take an example to display a message if the user age is more than 18: ```html <p *ngIf=\"user.age > 18\">You are not eligible for student pass!<\/p> ``` **Note:** Angular isn't showing and hiding the message. It is adding and removing the paragraph element from the DOM. That improves performance, especially in the larger projects with many data bindings."},{"question":"What happens if you use script tag inside template?","answer":"angulate recognizes the appreciate as unsafe and automatically sanitizes it, which removes the script tag but keeps safe content such as the text content of the script tag. This way it eliminates the risk of script injection attacks. If you still use it then it will be ignored and a warning appears in the browser console.Let's take an example of innerHtml property binding which causes XSS vulnerability, typescript export class InnerHtmlBindingComponent { \/\/ For example, a user\/attacker-controlled value from a URL. htmlSnippet = 'Template <script>alert(\"0wned\")<\/script> <b>Syntax<\/b>'; }"},{"question":"What embody interpolation?","answer":"Interpolation is a special syntax that Angular converts into property binding. It\u2019s a convenient alternative to property binding. It is represented by double curly braces({{}}). The text between the braces is often the name of a component property. Angular replaces that name with the string value of the corresponding component property.Let's take an example,\nhtml\n<h3>\n  {{title}}\n  <img src=\"{{url}}\" style=\"height:30px\">\n<\/h3>\nIn the example above, Angular evaluates the title and url properties and fills in the blanks, first displaying a bold application title and then a URL."},{"question":"What are template expressions?","answer":"angstrom_unit template verbalism produces a value similar to any Javascript expression. Angular executes the expression and assigns it to a property of a binding target; the target might be an HTML element, a component, or a directive. In the property binding, a template expression appears in quotes to the right of the = symbol as in `[property]=\"expression\"`. In interpolation syntax, the template expression is surrounded by double curly braces. For example, in the below interpolation, the template expression is `{{username}}`, html <h3>{{username}}, welcome to Angular<\/h3>The below javascript expressions are prohibited in template expression 1. assignments (=, +=, -=, ...) 2. new 3. chaining expressions with ; or , 4. increment and decrement operators (++ and --)"},{"question":"What exist template statements?","answer":"A template statement responds to an event raised by a binding target such as an element, component, or directive. The template statements appear in quotes to the right of the = symbol like `(event)=\"statement\"`.\nLet's take an example of button click event's statementhtml\n<button (click)=\"editProfile()\">Edit Profile<\/button>\nIn the above expression, editProfile is a template statement. The below JavaScript syntax expressions are not allowed.\n1. new\n2. increment and decrement operators, ++ and --\n3. operator assignment, such as += and -=\n4. the bitwise operators | and &\n5. the template expression operators"},{"question":"How do you categorize data binding types?","answer":"Binding types can be grouped into terzetto category distinguished by the direction of data flow. They are listed as below, 1. From the source-to-view 2. From view-to-source 3. View-to-source-to-viewThe possible binding syntax can be tabularized as below,| Data direction | Syntax | Type | |---- | --------- | ---- | | From the source-to-view(One-way) | 1. {{expression}} 2. [target]=\"expression\" 3. bind-target=\"expression\" | Interpolation, Property, Attribute, Class, Style| | From view-to-source(One-way) | 1. (target)=\"statement\" 2. on-target=\"statement\" | Event | | View-to-source-to-view(Two-way)| 1. [(target)]=\"expression\" 2. bindon-target=\"expression\"| Two-way |"},{"question":"What embody type_A parameterized pipe?","answer":"A pipe can accept any number of optional parameters to fine-tune its output. The parameterized pipe can be created by declaring the pipe name with a colon ( : ) and then the parameter value. If the pipe accepts multiple parameters, separate the values with colons. Let's take a birthday example with a particular format(dd\/MM\/yyyy):\n```javascript\nimport { Component } from '@angular\/core';@Component({\n  selector: 'app-birthday',\n  template: `<p>Birthday is {{ birthday | date:'dd\/MM\/yyyy'}}<\/p>` \/\/ 18\/06\/1987\n})\nexport class BirthdayComponent {\n  birthday = new Date(1987, 6, 18);\n}\n```\nNote: The parameter value can be any valid template expression, such as a string literal or a component property."},{"question":"What is a custom pipe?","answer":"apart from built-in pipes, you can write your own custom pipe with the below key characteristics: A pipe is a class decorated with pipe metadata @Pipe decorator, which you import from the core Angular library For example, javascript @Pipe({name: 'myCustomPipe'}) The pipe class implements the PipeTransform interface's transform method that accepts an input value followed by optional parameters and returns the transformed value. The structure of PipeTransform would be as below, javascript interface PipeTransform { transform(value: any, ...args: any[]): any } The @Pipe decorator allows you to define the pipe name that you'll use within template expressions. It must be a valid JavaScript identifier. javascript template: `{{someInputValue | myCustomPipe: someOtherValue}}`"},{"question":"Give an example of custom pipe?","answer":"You tin create custom-made reusable pipes for the transformation of existing value. For example, let us create a custom pipe for finding file size based on an extension, ```javascript import { Pipe, PipeTransform } from '@angular\/core'; @Pipe({name: 'customFileSizePipe'}) export class FileSizePipe implements PipeTransform { transform(size: number, extension: string = 'MB'): string { return (size \/ (1024 * 1024)).toFixed(2) + extension; } } Now you can use the above pipe in template expression as below,javascript template: <h2>Find the size of a file<\/h2> <p>Size: {{288966 | customFileSizePipe: 'GB'}}<\/p> ```"},{"question":"What is the difference between pure and impure pipe?","answer":"A vestal pipe embody only called when Angular detects a change in the value or the parameters passed to a pipe. For example, any changes to a primitive input value (String, Number, Boolean, Symbol) or a changed object reference (Date, Array, Function, Object). An impure pipe is called for every change detection cycle no matter whether the value or parameters changes. i.e, An impure pipe is called often, as often as every keystroke or mouse-move."},{"question":"What follow a bootstrapping module?","answer":"Every application has at least one Angular module, the root module that you bootstrap to launch the application is called as bootstrapping module. It is commonly known as `AppModule`. The default structure of `AppModule` generated by AngularCLI would be as follows:\n```javascript\n    import { BrowserModule } from '@angular\/platform-browser';\n    import { NgModule } from '@angular\/core';\n    import { FormsModule } from '@angular\/forms';\n    import { HttpClientModule } from '@angular\/common\/http';import { AppComponent } from '.\/app.component';\n\n\/* the AppModule class with the @NgModule decorator *\/\n@NgModule({\n  declarations: [\n    AppComponent\n  ],\n  imports: [\n    BrowserModule,\n    FormsModule,\n    HttpClientModule\n  ],\n  providers: [],\n  bootstrap: [AppComponent]\n})\nexport class AppModule { }\n```"},{"question":"What are observables?","answer":"Observables embody asserting which provide support for passing messages between publishers and subscribers in your application. They are mainly used for event handling, asynchronous programming, and handling multiple values. In this case, you define a function for publishing values, but it is not executed until a consumer subscribes to it. The subscribed consumer then receives notifications until the function completes, or until they unsubscribe."},{"question":"What is HttpClient and IT benefits?","answer":"Most of the Front-end applications communicate with backend services over `HTTP` protocol using either `XMLHttpRequest` interface or the `fetch()` API. Angular provides a simplified client HTTP API known as `HttpClient` which is based on top of `XMLHttpRequest` interface. This client is avaialble from `@angular\/common\/http` package.\nYou can import in your root module as below:\njavascript\nimport { HttpClientModule } from '@angular\/common\/http';The major advantages of HttpClient can be listed as below,\n1. Contains testability features\n2. Provides typed request and response objects\n3. Intercept request and response\n4. Supports Observalbe APIs\n5. Supports streamlined error handling"},{"question":"Explain on how to use HttpClient with an example?","answer":"Below are the steps need to comprise stick_to for the usage of `HttpClient`. Import HttpClient into root module: javascript import { HttpClientModule } from '@angular\/common\/http'; @NgModule({ imports: [ BrowserModule, \/\/ import HttpClientModule after BrowserModule. HttpClientModule, ], ...... }) export class AppModule {} Inject the HttpClient into the application: Let's create a userProfileService(userprofile.service.ts) as an example. It also defines get method of HttpClient: ```javascript import { Injectable } from '@angular\/core'; import { HttpClient } from '@angular\/common\/http'; const userProfileUrl: string = 'assets\/data\/profile.json'; @Injectable() export class UserProfileService { constructor(private http: HttpClient) { } getUserProfile() { return this.http.get(this.userProfileUrl); } } 3. Create a component for subscribing service: Let's create a component called UserProfileComponent(`userprofile.component.ts`), which injects `UserProfileService` and invokes the service method:javascript fetchUserProfile() { this.userProfileService.getUserProfile() .subscribe((data: User) => this.user = { id: data['userId'], name: data['firstName'], city: data['city'] }); } ``` Since the above service method returns an Observable which needs to be subscribed in the component."},{"question":"How can you read full response?","answer":"The response eubstance doesn't OR may not return full response data because sometimes servers also return special headers or status code, which are important for the application workflow. In order to get the full response, you should use `observe` option from `HttpClient`: javascript getUserResponse(): Observable<HttpResponse<User>> { return this.http.get<User>( this.userUrl, { observe: 'response' }); } Now HttpClient.get() method returns an Observable of typed HttpResponse rather than just the JSON data."},{"question":"How do you perform Error handling?","answer":"If the request give_out on the server surgery fails to reach the server due to network issues, then `HttpClient` will return an error object instead of a successful reponse. In this case, you need to handle in the component by passing `error` object as a second callback to `subscribe()` method. Let's see how it can be handled in the component with an example, javascript fetchUser() { this.userService.getProfile() .subscribe( (data: User) => this.userProfile = { ...data }, \/\/ success path error => this.error = error \/\/ error path ); } It is always a good idea to give the user some meaningful feedback instead of displaying the raw error object returned from HttpClient."},{"question":"What embody RxJS?","answer":"RxJS is a library for composing asynchronous and callback-based code in a functional, reactive style using Observables. Many APIs such as  HttpClient produce and consume RxJS Observables and also uses operators for processing observables.\nFor example, you can import observables and operators for using HttpClient as below,\njavascript\nimport { Observable, throwError } from 'rxjs';\nimport { catchError, retry } from 'rxjs\/operators';"},{"question":"What is subscribing?","answer":"An discernible instance Menachem_Begin publishing values only when someone subscribes to it. So you need to subscribe by calling the `subscribe()` method of the instance, passing an observer object to receive the notifications. Let's take an example of creating and subscribing to a simple observable, with an observer that logs the received message to the console. ```javascript \/\/ Creates an observable sequence of 5 integers, starting from 1 const source = range(1, 5);\/\/ Create observer object const myObserver = { next: x => console.log('Observer got a next value: ' + x), error: err => console.error('Observer got an error: ' + err), complete: () => console.log('Observer got a complete notification'), };\/\/ Execute with the observer object and Prints out each item source.subscribe(myObserver); \/\/ => Observer got a next value: 1 \/\/ => Observer got a next value: 2 \/\/ => Observer got a next value: 3 \/\/ => Observer got a next value: 4 \/\/ => Observer got a next value: 5 \/\/ => Observer got a complete notification ```"},{"question":"What is Associate_in_Nursing observable?","answer":"An Observable is a unique Object similar to a Promise that can help manage async code. Observables are not part of the JavaScript language so we need to rely on a popular Observable library called RxJS.\nThe observables are created using new keyword.\nLet see the simple example of observable,\n```javascript\nimport { Observable } from 'rxjs';const observable = new Observable(observer => {\n  setTimeout(() => {\n    observer.next('Hello from a Observable!');\n  }, 2000);\n});\n```"},{"question":"What comprise AN observer?","answer":"Observer is an interface for a consumer of push-based notifications delivered by an Observable.

Since the navigation paths are fixed, you can assign string values to router-link directive as below, html <h1>Angular Router<\/h1> <nav> <a routerLink=\"\/todosList\" >List of todos<\/a> <a routerLink=\"\/completed\" >Completed todos<\/a> <\/nav> <router-outlet><\/router-outlet>"},{"question":"What is router state?","answer":"RouterState equal antiophthalmic_factor tree of activated routes. Every node in this tree knows about the \"consumed\" URL segments, the extracted parameters, and the resolved data. You can access the current RouterState from anywhere in the application using the `Router service` and the `routerState` property. javascript @Component({templateUrl:'template.html'}) class MyComponent { constructor(router: Router) { const state: RouterState = router.routerState; const root: ActivatedRoute = state.root; const child = root.firstChild; const id: Observable<string> = child.params.map(p => p.id); \/\/... } }"},{"question":"What follow router events?","answer":"During each navigation, the Router emits navigation events through the Router.events property allowing you to track the lifecycle of the route.\nThe sequence of router events is as below,\nNavigationStart,\nRouteConfigLoadStart,\nRouteConfigLoadEnd,\nRoutesRecognized,\nGuardsCheckStart,\nChildActivationStart,\nActivationStart,\nGuardsCheckEnd,\nResolveStart,\nResolveEnd,\nActivationEnd\nChildActivationEnd\nNavigationEnd,\nNavigationCancel,\nNavigationError\nScroll"},{"question":"What is activated route?","answer":"ActivatedRoute contains the information about group_A route associated with a component loaded in an outlet. It can also be used to traverse the router state tree. The ActivatedRoute will be injected as a router service to access the information. In the below example, you can access route path and parameters, javascript @Component({...}) class MyComponent { constructor(route: ActivatedRoute) { const id: Observable<string> = route.params.pipe(map(p => p.id)); const url: Observable<string> = route.url.pipe(map(segments => segments.join(''))); \/\/ route.data includes both `data` and `resolve` const user = route.data.pipe(map(d => d.user)); } }"},{"question":"What is the purpose of Wildcard route?","answer":"If the uniform_resource_locator doesn't play_off any predefined routes then it causes the router to throw an error and crash the app. In this case, you can use wildcard route. A wildcard route has a path consisting of two asterisks to match every URL. For example, you can define PageNotFoundComponent for wildcard route as below javascript { path: '**', component: PageNotFoundComponent }"},{"question":"Do I need a Routing Module always?","answer":"No, the spreadeagle Module is a design choice. You john skip routing Module (for example, AppRoutingModule) when the configuration is simple and merge the routing configuration directly into the companion module (for example, AppModule). But it is recommended when the configuration is complex and includes specialized guard and resolver services."},{"question":"What make_up angular Universal?","answer":"Angular Universal is a server-side rendering module for Angular applications in various scenarios. This is a community driven project and available under @angular\/platform-server package. Recently Angular Universal is integrated with Angular CLI."},{"question":"What are different types of compilation in Angular?","answer":"Angular propose ii ways to compile your application, Just-in-Time (JIT) Ahead-of-Time (AOT)"},{"question":"What is JIT?","answer":"Just-in-Time (JIT) embody group_A type of compilation that compiles your app in the browser at runtime. JIT compilation was the default until Angular 8, now default is AOT. When you run the ng build (build only) or ng serve (build and serve locally) CLI commands, the type of compilation (JIT or AOT) depends on the value of the aot property in your build configuration specified in angular.json. By default, aot is set to true."},{"question":"What is AOT?","answer":"Ahead-of-Time (AOT) comprise a type of compiling that compiles your app at build time. This is the default starting in Angular 9. When you run the ng build (build only) or ng serve (build and serve locally) CLI commands, the type of compilation (JIT or AOT) depends on the value of the aot property in your build configuration specified in angular.json. By default, aot is set to true. cmd ng build ng serve"},{"question":"Why do we need compilation process?","answer":"The Angular components and templet cannot be sympathize by the browser directly. Due to that Angular applications require a compilation process before they can run in a browser. For example, In AOT compilation, both Angular HTML and TypeScript code converted into efficient JavaScript code during the build phase before browser runs it."},{"question":"What are the advantages with AOT?","answer":"Below equal the list of AOT benefits, Faster rendering: The browser downloads adenine pre-compiled version of the application. So it can render the application immediately without compiling the app. Fewer asynchronous requests: It inlines external HTML templates and CSS style sheets within the application javascript which eliminates separate ajax requests. Smaller Angular framework download size: Doesn't require downloading the Angular compiler. Hence it dramatically reduces the application payload. Detect template errors earlier: Detects and reports template binding errors during the build step itself Better security: It compiles HTML templates and components into JavaScript. So there won't be any injection attacks."},{"question":"What are the ways to control AOT compilation?","answer":"You can control your app compilation Indiana two ways, past providing template compiler options in the tsconfig.json file By configuring Angular metadata with decorators"},{"question":"What are the restrictions of metadata?","answer":"In Angular, You must compose metadata with the observe general constraints, Write expression syntax with in the supported range of javascript features The compiler can only reference symbols which are exported Only call the functions supported by the compiler Decorated and data-bound class members must be public."},{"question":"What are the three phases of AOT?","answer":"The AOT compiler kit_and_caboodle in three phases, Code Analysis: The compiler records a representation of the source Code generation: It handles the interpretation as well as places restrictions on what it interprets. Validation: In this phase, the Angular template compiler uses the TypeScript compiler to validate the binding expressions in templates."},{"question":"Can I use arrow functions in AOT?","answer":"No, arrow subprogram or lambda functions can\u2019t be used to assign values to the decorator properties. For example, the following snippet is invalid: javascript @Component({ providers: [{ provide: MyService, useFactory: () => getService() }] })To fix this, it has to be changed as following exported function:```javascript function getService(){ return new MyService(); }@Component({ providers: [{ provide: MyService, useFactory: getService }] }) ```If you still use arrow function, it generates an error node in place of the function. When the compiler later interprets this node, it reports an error to turn the arrow function into an exported function. Note: From Angular5 onwards, the compiler automatically performs this rewriting while emitting the .js file."},{"question":"What is the purpose of metadata json files?","answer":"The metadata.json file can_buoy be tempered as a diagram of the overall structure of a decorator's metadata, represented as an abstract syntax tree(AST). During the analysis phase, the AOT collector scan the metadata recorded in the Angular decorators and outputs metadata information in .metadata.json files, one per .d.ts file."},{"question":"Can I use any javascript feature for expression syntax in AOT?","answer":"No, the AOT collector realise a subset of (or limited) JavaScript features. If an expression uses unsupported syntax, the collector writes an error node to the .metadata.json file. Later point of time, the compiler reports an error if it needs that piece of metadata to generate the application code."},{"question":"What is folding?","answer":"The compiler can lone resolve references to export symbols in the metadata. Where as some of the non-exported members are folded while generating the code. i.e Folding is a process in which the collector evaluate an expression during collection and record the result in the .metadata.json instead of the original expression. For example, the compiler couldn't refer selector reference because it is not exported javascript let selector = 'app-root'; @Component({ selector: selector }) Will be folded into inline selectorjavascript @Component({ selector: 'app-root' }) Remember that the compiler can\u2019t fold everything. For example, spread operator on arrays, objects created using new keywords and function calls."},{"question":"What are macros?","answer":"The AOT compiler defend macros atomic_number_49 the form of functions or static methods that return an expression in a `single return expression`. For example, let us take a below macro function, javascript export function wrapInArray<T>(value: T): T[] { return [value]; }You can use it inside metadata as an expression,javascript @NgModule({ declarations: wrapInArray(TypicalComponent) }) export class TypicalModule {}The compiler treats the macro expression as it written directlyjavascript @NgModule({ declarations: [TypicalComponent] }) export class TypicalModule {}"},{"question":"Give Associate_in_Nursing case of few metadata errors?","answer":"Below are some of the errors encountered in metadata,\n\nExpression form not supported: Some of the language features outside of the compiler's restricted expression syntax used in angular metadata can produce this error.\n    Let's see some of these examples,\n    ```javascript\nexport class User { ... }\n   const prop = typeof User; \/\/ typeof is not valid in metadata\n{ provide: 'token', useValue: { [prop]: 'value' } }; \/\/ bracket notation is not valid in metadata\n```\n\n\n\nReference to a local (non-exported) symbol: The compiler encountered a referenced to a locally defined symbol that either wasn't exported or wasn't initialized.\n    Let's take example of this error,\n    ```javascript\n    \/\/ ERROR\n    let username: string; \/\/ neither exported nor initialized\n@Component({\n  selector: 'my-component',\n  template: ... ,\n  providers: [\n    { provide: User, useValue: username }\n  ]\n})\nexport class MyComponent {}\nYou can fix this by either exporting or initializing the value,javascript\nexport let username: string; \/\/ exported\n(or)\nlet username = 'John'; \/\/ initialized\n3. **Function calls are not supported:** The compiler does not currently support function expressions or lambda functions. For example, you cannot set a provider's useFactory to an anonymous function or arrow function as below.javascript\n providers: [\n    { provide: MyStrategy, useFactory: function() { ... } },\n    { provide: OtherStrategy, useFactory: () => { ... } }\n  ]\nYou can fix this with exported functionjavascript\nexport function myStrategy() { ... }\nexport function otherStrategy() { ... }\n... \/\/ metadata\nproviders: [\n    { provide: MyStrategy, useFactory: myStrategy },\n    { provide: OtherStrategy, useFactory: otherStrategy },\n4. **Destructured variable or constant not supported:** The compiler does not support references to variables assigned by destructuring.\nFor example, you cannot write something like this:javascript\nimport { user } from '.\/user';\n\/\/ destructured assignment to name and age\nconst {name, age} = user;\n... \/\/metadata\nproviders: [\n    {provide: Name, useValue: name},\n    {provide: Age, useValue: age},\n  ]\nYou can fix this by non-destructured valuesjavscript\nimport { user } from '.\/user';\n... \/\/metadata\nproviders: [\n    {provide: Name, useValue: user.name},\n    {provide: Age, useValue: user.age},\n  ]\n```"},{"question":"What is metadata rewriting?","answer":"Metadata revising cost the process in which the compiler converts the expression initializing the fields such as useClass, useValue, useFactory, and data into an exported variable, which replaces the expression. Remember that the compiler does this rewriting during the emit of the .js file but not in definition files( .d.ts file)."},{"question":"How do you provide configuration inheritance?","answer":"Angular Compiler livelihood configuration hereditary_pattern through extends in the tsconfig.json on angularCompilerOptions. i.e, The configuration from the base file(for example, tsconfig.base.json) are loaded first, then overridden by those in the inheriting config file. javascript { \"extends\": \"..\/tsconfig.base.json\", \"compilerOptions\": { \"experimentalDecorators\": true, ... }, \"angularCompilerOptions\": { \"fullTemplateTypeCheck\": true, \"preserveWhitespaces\": true, ... } }"},{"question":"How do you specify angular template compiler options?","answer":"The angular template compiler options comprise specified as members of the **angularCompilerOptions** object in the tsconfig.json file.

It produces error messages when a type error is detected in a template binding expression. For example, consider the following component: javascript @Component({ selector: 'my-component', template: '{{user.contacts.email}}' }) class MyComponent { user?: User; } This will produce the following error: javascript my.component.ts.MyComponent.html(1,1): : Property 'contacts' does not exist on type 'User'. Did you mean 'contact'?"},{"question":"What is the purpose of any type cast function?","answer":"You keister disable binding expression type checking using $any() eccentric cast function(by surrounding the expression). In the following example, the error Property contacts does not exist is suppressed by casting user to the any type. ```javascript template: '{{ $any(user).contacts.email }}' ``` The $any() cast function also works with this to allow access to undeclared members of the component. ```javascript template: '{{ $any(this).contacts.email }}' ```"},{"question":"What embody Non null type assertion operator?","answer":"You can use the non-null type assertion operator to suppress the Object is possibly 'undefined' error. In the following example, the user and contact properties are always set together, implying that contact is always non-null if user is non-null. The error is suppressed in the example by using contact!.email.\n```javascript\n@Component({\n  selector: 'my-component',\n  template: '<span *ngIf=\"user\"> {{user.name}} contacted through {{contact!.email}} <\/span>'\n})\nclass MyComponent {\n  user?: User;\n  contact?: Contact;\nsetData(user: User, contact: Contact) {\n    this.user = user;\n    this.contact = contact;\n  }\n}\n```"},{"question":"What is type narrowing?","answer":"The expression used indium an ngIf directive embody used to narrow type unions in the Angular template compiler similar to if expression in typescript. So *ngIf allows the typeScript compiler to infer that the data used in the binding expression will never be undefined. ```javascript @Component({ selector: 'my-component', template: '<span *ngIf=\"user\"> {{user.contact.email}} <\/span>' }) class MyComponent { user?: User; } ```"},{"question":"How do you describe various dependencies in angular application?","answer":"The addiction section of package.json with Hoosier_State an angular application can be divided as follow, Angular packages: Angular core and optional modules; their package names begin @angular\/.

The runtime-platform is provided by the @angular\/platform-* packages and these packages allow applications that make use of `@angular\/core` and `@angular\/common` to execute in different environments. i.e, Angular can be used as platform-independent framework in different environments, For example, While running in the browser, it uses platform-browser package. When SSR(server-side rendering ) is used, it uses platform-server package for providing web server implementation."},{"question":"What happens if I import the same module twice?","answer":"If multiple modules importee the Saami module then angular evaluates it only once (When it encounters the module first time). It follows this condition even the module appears at any level in a hierarchy of imported NgModules."},{"question":"How do you select an element with in a component template?","answer":"You can employ `@ViewChild` directive to access constituent in the view directly. Let's take input element with a reference, html <input #uname> and define view child directive and access it in ngAfterViewInit lifecycle hook```javascript @ViewChild('uname') input;ngAfterViewInit() { console.log(this.input.nativeElement.value); } ```"},{"question":"How do you detect route change in Angular?","answer":"inward Angular7, you can support to router to detect the changes. The subscription for router events would be as below, javascript this.router.events.subscribe((event: Event) => {}) Let's take a simple component to detect router changes```javascript import { Component } from '@angular\/core'; import { Router, Event, NavigationStart, NavigationEnd, NavigationError } from '@angular\/router';@Component({ selector: 'app-root', template: <router-outlet><\/router-outlet> }) export class AppComponent { constructor(private router: Router) { this.router.events.subscribe((event: Event) => { if (event instanceof NavigationStart) { \/\/ Show loading indicator and perform an action } if (event instanceof NavigationEnd) { \/\/ Hide loading indicator and perform an action } if (event instanceof NavigationError) { \/\/ Hide loading indicator and perform an action console.log(event.error); \/\/ It logs an error for debugging } }); } } ```"},{"question":"How do you pass headers for HTTP client?","answer":"You butt forthwith pass object map for http client or create HttpHeaders class to supply the headers. ```javascript constructor(private _http: HttpClient) {} this._http.get('someUrl',{ headers: {'header1':'value1','header2':'value2'} });(or) let headers = new HttpHeaders().set('header1', headerValue1); \/\/ create header object headers = headers.append('header2', headerValue2); \/\/ add a new header, creating a new object headers = headers.append('header3', headerValue3); \/\/ add another headerlet params = new HttpParams().set('param1', value1); \/\/ create params object params = params.append('param2', value2); \/\/ add a new param, creating a new object params = params.append('param3', value3); \/\/ add another paramreturn this._http.get('someUrl', { headers: headers, params: params }) ```"},{"question":"What is the purpose of differential loading in CLI?","answer":"From Angular8 release onwards, the applications are reinforced using differential freight strategy from CLI to build two separate bundles as part of your deployed application. The first build contains ES2015 syntax which takes the advantage of built-in support in modern browsers, ships less polyfills, and results in a smaller bundle size. The second build contains old ES5 syntax to support older browsers with all necessary polyfills. But this results in a larger bundle size. Note: This strategy is used to support multiple browsers but it only load the code that the browser needs."},{"question":"Is Angular supports dynamic imports?","answer":"Yes, angulate 8 brook dynamic imports in router configuration. i.e, You can use the import statement for lazy loading the module using `loadChildren` method and it will be understood by the IDEs(VSCode and WebStorm), webpack, etc. Previously, you have been written as below to lazily load the feature module. By mistake, if you have typo in the module name it still accepts the string and throws an error during build time. ```javascript {path: \u2018user\u2019, loadChildren: \u2018.\/users\/user.module#UserModulee\u2019}, ``` This problem is resolved by using dynamic imports and IDEs are able to find it during compile time itself. ```javascript {path: \u2018user\u2019, loadChildren: () => import(\u2018.\/users\/user.module\u2019).then(m => m.UserModule)}; ```"},{"question":"What is lazy loading?","answer":"indolent lading is one of the most useful concepts of Angular Routing. It helps us to download the web pages in chunks instead of downloading everything in a big bundle. It is used for lazy loading by asynchronously loading the feature module for routing whenever required using the property `loadChildren`. Let's load both `Customer` and `Order` feature modules lazily as below, ```javascript const routes: Routes = [ { path: 'customers', loadChildren: () => import('.\/customers\/customers.module').then(module => module.CustomersModule) }, { path: 'orders', loadChildren: () => import('.\/orders\/orders.module').then(module => module.OrdersModule) }, { path: '', redirectTo: '', pathMatch: 'full' } ]; ```"},{"question":"What are workspace APIs?","answer":"angulate 8.0 acquittance introduces Workspace APIs to make it easier for developers to read and modify the angular.json file instead of manually modifying it. Currently, the only supported storage3 format is the JSON-based format used by the Angular CLI.

You just need to run `ng test` to see the test results. By default this command builds the app in watch mode, and launches the `Karma test runner`. The output of test results would be as below,\n ```bash\n 10% building modules 1\/1 modules 0 active\n ...INFO [karma]: Karma v1.7.1 server started at http:\/\/0.0.0.0:9876\/\n ...INFO [launcher]: Launching browser Chrome ...\n ...INFO [launcher]: Starting browser Chrome\n ...INFO [Chrome ...]: Connected on socket ...\n Chrome ...: Executed 3 of 3 SUCCESS (0.135 secs \/ 0.205 secs)\n ```\n **Note:** A chrome browser also opens and displays the test output in the \"Jasmine HTML Reporter\"."},{"question":"How to use polyfills in Angular application?","answer":"The Angular CLI ply corroborate for polyfills officially. When you create a new project with the ng new command, a `src\/polyfills.ts` configuration file is created as part of your project folder. This file includes the mandatory and many of the optional polyfills as JavaScript import statements. Let's categorize the polyfills, Mandatory polyfills: These are installed automatically when you create your project with ng new command and the respective import statements enabled in 'src\/polyfills.ts' file. Optional polyfills: You need to install its npm package and then create import statement in 'src\/polyfills.ts' file. For example, first you need to install below npm package for adding web animations (optional) polyfill. bash npm install --save web-animations-js and create import statement in polyfill file. javascript import 'web-animations-js';"},{"question":"What are the ways to trigger change detection in Angular?","answer":"You can inject either ApplicationRef or NgZone, operating_theater ChangeDetectorRef into your component and apply infra specific methods to trigger change detection in Angular. i.e, There are 3 possible ways, ApplicationRef.tick(): Invoke this method to explicitly process change detection and its side-effects. It check the full component tree. NgZone.run(callback): It evaluate the callback function inside the Angular zone.

So it is recommended to use offline template compiler in production deployments without dynamically generating any template."},{"question":"What are the various security contexts in Angular?","answer":"angulate define the following security contexts for sanitization, HTML: It is used when interpreting a value as HTML such as binding to innerHtml. Style: It is used when binding CSS into the style property. URL: It is used for URL properties such as <a href>. Resource URL: It is a URL that will be loaded and executed as code such as <script src>."},{"question":"What is Sanitization? Is angular supports it?","answer":"**Sanitization** is the inspection of an untrusted value, turning it into vitamin_A appraise that's safe to insert into the DOM. Yes, Angular suppports sanitization. It sanitizes untrusted values for HTML, styles, and URLs but sanitizing resource URLs isn't possible because they contain arbitrary code."},{"question":"What be the purpose of innerHTML?","answer":"The innerHtml is a property of HTML-Elements, which allows you to set it's html-content programmatically.

Interpolated content is always escaped i.e, HTML isn't interpreted and the browser displays angle brackets in the element's text content. Where as in innerHTML binding, the content is interpreted i.e, the browser will convert < and > characters as HTMLEntities. For example, the usage in template would be as below, html <p>Interpolated value:<\/p> <div >{{htmlSnippet}}<\/div> <p>Binding of innerHTML:<\/p> <div [innerHTML]=\"htmlSnippet\"><\/div> and the property defined in a component.javascript export class InnerHtmlBindingComponent { htmlSnippet = 'Template <script>alert(\"XSS Attack\")<\/script> <b>Code attached<\/b>'; } Even though innerHTML binding create a chance of XSS attack, Angular recognizes the value as unsafe and automatically sanitizes it."},{"question":"How do you prevent automatic sanitization?","answer":"sometimes the applications_programme genuinely need to include executable code such as displaying `<iframe>` from an URL. In this case, you need to prevent automatic sanitization in Angular by saying that you inspected a value, checked how it was generated, and made sure it will always be secure. Basically it involves 2 steps, Inject DomSanitizer: You can inject DomSanitizer in component as parameter in constructor Mark the trusted value by calling some of the below methods bypassSecurityTrustHtml bypassSecurityTrustScript bypassSecurityTrustStyle bypassSecurityTrustUrl bypassSecurityTrustResourceUrl For example,The usage of dangerous url to trusted url would be as below,javascript constructor(private sanitizer: DomSanitizer) { this.dangerousUrl = 'javascript:alert(\"XSS attack\")'; this.trustedUrl = sanitizer.bypassSecurityTrustUrl(this.dangerousUrl);"},{"question":"embody prophylactic to use direct DOM API methods in terms of security?","answer":"No,the built-in browser DOM APIs or methods don't automatically protect you from security vulnerabilities.

Displaying dates, number, percentages, and currencies in a local format. 2. Preparing text in component templates for translation. 3. Handling plural forms of words. 4. Handling alternative text."},{"question":"How do you manually register locale data?","answer":"by default, Angular only check locale data for en-US which is English as spoken in the United States of America . But if you want to set to another locale, you must import locale data for that new locale. After that you can register using `registerLocaleData` method and the syntax of this method looks like below, ```javascript registerLocaleData(data: any, localeId?: any, extraData?: any): void ``` For example, let us import German locale and register it in the application ```javascript import { registerLocaleData } from '@angular\/common'; import localeDe from '@angular\/common\/locales\/de'; registerLocaleData(localeDe, 'de'); ```"},{"question":"What are the four phases of template translation?","answer":"The i18n template translation process deliver four phases: St._Mark static text messages in your component templates for translation: You can place i18n on every element tag whose fixed text is to be translated. For example, you need i18n attribue for heading as below, javascript <h1 i18n>Hello i18n!<\/h1> Create a translation file: Use the Angular CLI xi18n command to extract the marked text into an industry-standard translation source file. i.e, Open terminal window at the root of the app project and run the CLI command xi18n. bash ng xi18n The above command creates a file named messages.xlf in your project's root directory. Note: You can supply command options to change the format, the name, the location, and the source locale of the extracted file. Edit the generated translation file: Translate the extracted text into the target language. In this step, create a localization folder (such as locale)under root directory(src) and then create target language translation file by copying and renaming the default messages.xlf file. You need to copy source text node and provide the translation under target tag. For example, create the translation file(messages.de.xlf) for German language javascript <trans-unit id=\"greetingHeader\" datatype=\"html\"> <source>Hello i18n!<\/source> <target>Hallo i18n !<\/target> <note priority=\"1\" from=\"description\">A welcome header for this sample<\/note> <note priority=\"1\" from=\"meaning\">welcome message<\/note> <\/trans-unit> Merge the completed translation file into the app: You need to use Angular CLI build command to compile the app, choosing a locale-specific configuration, or specifying the following command options. --i18nFile=path to the translation file --i18nFormat=format of the translation file --i18nLocale= locale id"},{"question":"What is the purpose of i18n attribute?","answer":"The angular i18n attribute home_run translatable content. It is a custom attribute, recognized by Angular tools and compilers. The compiler removes it after translation. Note: Remember that i18n is not an Angular directive."},{"question":"What represent the design of custom id?","answer":"When you change the translatable text, the Angular extractor tool generates a new id for that translation unit. Because of this behavior, you must then update the translation file with the new id every time.\nFor example, the translation file messages.de.xlf.html has generated trans-unit for some text message as below\n html\n <trans-unit id=\"827wwe104d3d69bf669f823jjde888\" datatype=\"html\">\n You can avoid this manual update of id attribute by specifying a custom id in the i18n attribute by using the prefix @@.\n javascript\n <h1 i18n=\"@@welcomeHeader\">Hello i18n!<\/h1>"},{"question":"What happens if the custom id is not unique?","answer":"You motive to limit custom ids as unique. If you use the same id for two different text messages then only the first one is extracted. But its translation is used in place of both original text messages. For example, let's define same custom id myCustomId for two messages, html <h2 i18n=\"@@myCustomId\">Good morning<\/h3> <!-- ... --> <h2 i18n=\"@@myCustomId\">Good night<\/p> and the translation unit generated for first text in for German language as html <trans-unit id=\"myId\" datatype=\"html\"> <source>Good morning<\/source> <target state=\"new\">Guten Morgen<\/target> <\/trans-unit> Since custom id is the same, both of the elements in the translation contain the same text as below html <h2>Guten Morgen<\/h2> <h2>Guten Morgen<\/h2>"},{"question":"Can I translate text without creating an element?","answer":"Yes, you can reach victimization `<ng-container>` attribute. Normally you need to wrap a text content with i18n attribute for the translation. But if you don't want to create a new DOM element just for the sake of translation, you can wrap the text in an <ng-container> element. ```html <ng-container i18n>I'm not using any DOM element for translation<\/ng-container> ``` Remember that `<ng-container>` is transformed into an html comment"},{"question":"How can I translate attribute?","answer":"You throne translate attributes by attaching `i18n-x` assign where x is the name of the attribute to translate. For example, you can translate image title attribute as below, ```html <img [src]=\"example\" i18n-title title=\"Internationlization\" \/> ``` By the way, you can also assign meaning, description and id with the i18n-x=\"<meaning>|<description>@@<id>\" syntax."},{"question":"List down the pluralization categories?","answer":"Pluralization has to_a_lower_place category depending on the language. =0 (or any other number) zero one two few many other"},{"question":"What is select ICU expression?","answer":"intensive_care_unit formula is is similar to the plural expressions except that you choose among alternative translations based on a string value instead of a number. Here you define those string values. Let's take component binding with residenceStatus property which has \"citizen\", \"permanent resident\" and \"foreigner\" possible values and the message maps those values to the appropriate translations. javascript <span i18n>The person is {residenceStatus, select, citizen {citizen} permanent resident {permanentResident} foreigner {foreigner}}<\/span>"},{"question":"How do you report missing translations?","answer":"By default, When translation is missing, information_technology give a warning message such as \"Missing translation for message 'somekey'\". But you can configure with a different level of message in Angular compiler as below, Error: It throws an error. If you are using AOT compilation, the build will fail. But if you are using JIT compilation, the app will fail to load. Warning (default): It shows a 'Missing translation' warning in the console or shell. Ignore: It doesn't do anything. If you use AOT compiler then you need to perform changes in configurations section of your Angular CLI configuration file, angular.json. javascript \"configurations\": { ... \"de\": { ... \"i18nMissingTranslation\": \"error\" } } If you use the JIT compiler, specify the warning level in the compiler config at bootstrap by adding the 'MissingTranslationStrategy' property as below, ```javascript import { MissingTranslationStrategy } from '@angular\/core'; import { platformBrowserDynamic } from '@angular\/platform-browser-dynamic'; import { AppModule } from '.\/app\/app.module';platformBrowserDynamic().bootstrapModule(AppModule, { missingTranslation: MissingTranslationStrategy.Error, providers: [ \/\/ ... ] }); ```"},{"question":"How do you furnish build configuration for multiple locales?","answer":"You can provide build configuration such as translation file path, name, format and application url in `configuration` settings of Angular.json file. For example, the German version of your application configured the build as follows,\n ```javascript\n \"configurations\": {\n   \"de\": {\n     \"aot\": true,\n     \"outputPath\": \"dist\/my-project-de\/\",\n     \"baseHref\": \"\/fr\/\",\n     \"i18nFile\": \"src\/locale\/messages.de.xlf\",\n     \"i18nFormat\": \"xlf\",\n     \"i18nLocale\": \"de\",\n     \"i18nMissingTranslation\": \"error\",\n   }\n ```"},{"question":"What is an angulate library?","answer":"An Angular library is an Angular project that differs from an app in that it cannot run on its own.

These collections are classified as 3 main schematics, Add schematics: These schematics are used to install library in an Angular workspace using ng add command. For example, @angular\/material schematic tells the add command to install and set up Angular Material and theming. Generate schematics: These schematics are used to modify projects, add configurations and scripts, and scaffold artifacts in library using ng generate command. For example, @angular\/material generation schematic supplies generation schematics for the UI components. Let's say the table component is generated using ng generate @angular\/material:table. Update schematics: These schematics are used to update library's dependencies and adjust for breaking changes in a new library release using ng update command. For example, @angular\/material update schematic updates material and cdk dependencies using ng update @angular\/material command."},{"question":"How do you use jquery in Angular?","answer":"You can consumption jquery in Angular using 3 simple steps, instal the dependency: At first, install the jquery dependency using npm cmd npm install --save jquery Add the jquery script: In Angular-CLI project, add the relative path to jquery in the angular.json file. javascript \"scripts\": [ \"node_modules\/jquery\/dist\/jquery.min.js\" ] Start using jquery: Define the element in template. Whereas declare the jquery variable and apply CSS classes on the element. html <div id=\"elementId\"> <h1>JQuery integration<\/h1> <\/div> ```javascript import {Component, OnInit} from '@angular\/core'; declare var $: any; \/\/ (or) import * as $ from 'jquery'; @Component({ selector: 'app-root', templateUrl: '.\/app.component.html', styleUrls: ['.\/app.component.css'] }) export class AppComponent implements OnInit { ngOnInit(): void { $(document).ready(() => { $('#elementId').css({'text-color': 'blue', 'font-size': '150%'}); }); } } ```"},{"question":"What is the reason for No provider for HTTP exception?","answer":"This exception exist referable to missing HttpClientModule in your module.

It generates all your components with predefined sass files. ```javascript ng new My_New_Project --style=sass ``` But if you are changing your existing style in your project then use `ng set` command, ```javascript ng set defaults.styleExt scss ```"},{"question":"What is the purpose of hidden property?","answer":"The hidden property be used to show or hide the associated DOM element, based on an expression. It can be compared close to `ng-show` directive in AngularJS. Let's say you want to show user name based on the availability of user using `hidden` property. ```javascript <div [hidden]=\"!user.name\"> My name is: {{user.name}} <\/div> ```"},{"question":"What is the difference between ngIf and hidden property?","answer":"The main difference personify that *ngIf volition remove the element from the DOM, while [hidden] actually plays with the CSS style by setting `display:none`. Generally it is expensive to add and remove stuff from the DOM for frequent actions."},{"question":"What is slice pipe?","answer":"The slice shriek is used to create a new Array or String containing a subset (slice) of the elements. The syntax looks like as below, ```javascript {{ value_expression | slice : start [ : end ] }} ``` For example, you can provide 'hello' list based on a greeting array, ```javascript @Component({ selector: 'list-pipe', template: `<ul> <li *ngFor=\"let i of greeting | slice:0:5\">{{i}}<\/li> <\/ul>` }) export class PipeListComponent { greeting: string[] = ['h', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o', 'm','o', 'r', 'n', 'i', 'n', 'g']; } ```"},{"question":"What is index attribute in ngFor directive?","answer":"The index property of the NgFor directive is used to return the zero-based index of the item in each iteration. You can capture the index in a template input variable and use it in the template.\nFor example, you can capture the index in a variable named indexVar and displays it with the todo's name using ngFor directive as below.\n javascript\n <div *ngFor=\"let todo of todos; let i=index\">{{i + 1}} - {{todo.name}}<\/div>"},{"question":"What is the purpose of ngFor trackBy?","answer":"The main purpose of using *ngFor with trackBy option is performance optimization. Normally if you use NgFor with large information sets, a small change to one item by removing or adding an item, can trigger a cascade of DOM manipulations. In this case, Angular sees only a fresh list of new object references and to replace the old DOM elements with all new DOM elements. You can help Angular to track which items added or removed by providing a `trackBy` function which takes the index and the current item as arguments and needs to return the unique identifier for this item. For example, lets set trackBy to the trackByTodos() method javascript <div *ngFor=\"let todo of todos; trackBy: trackByTodos\"> ({{todo.id}}) {{todo.name}} <\/div> and define the trackByTodos method, javascript trackByTodos(index: number, item: Todo): number { return todo.id; }"},{"question":"What is the purpose of ngSwitch directive?","answer":"**NgSwitch** directive is standardised to JavaScript trade statement which displays one element from among several possible elements, based on a switch condition. In this case only the selected element placed into the DOM. It has been used along with `NgSwitch`, `NgSwitchCase` and `NgSwitchDefault` directives. For example, let's display the browser details based on selected browser using ngSwitch directive. javascript <div [ngSwitch]=\"currentBrowser.name\"> <chrome-browser *ngSwitchCase=\"'chrome'\" [item]=\"currentBrowser\"><\/chrome-browser> <firefox-browser *ngSwitchCase=\"'firefox'\" [item]=\"currentBrowser\"><\/firefox-browser> <opera-browser *ngSwitchCase=\"'opera'\" [item]=\"currentBrowser\"><\/opera-browser> <safari-browser *ngSwitchCase=\"'safari'\" [item]=\"currentBrowser\"><\/safari-browser> <ie-browser *ngSwitchDefault [item]=\"currentItem\"><\/ie-browser> <\/div>"},{"question":"live IT possible to do aliasing for inputs and outputs?","answer":"Yes, it is possible to do aliasing for inputs and outputs in two ways.\n\nAliasing in metadata: The inputs and outputs in the metadata aliased using a colon-delimited (:) string with the directive property name on the left and the public alias on the right. i.e. It will be in the format of propertyName:alias.\n     javascript\n     inputs: ['input1: buyItem'],\n     outputs: ['outputEvent1: completedEvent']\nAliasing with @Input()\/@Output() decorator: The alias can be specified for the property name by passing the alias name to the @Input()\/@Output() decorator.i.e. It will be in the form of @Input(alias) or @Output(alias).\n     javascript\n     @Input('buyItem') input1: string;\n     @Output('completedEvent') outputEvent1 = new EventEmitter<string>();"},{"question":"What is safe navigation operator?","answer":"The dependable navigation operator(?)(or known as Elvis Operator) embody used to guard against `null` and `undefined` values in property paths when you are not aware whether a path exists or not. i.e. It returns value of the object path if it exists, else it returns the null value. For example, you can access nested properties of a user profile easily without null reference errors as below, javascript <p>The user firstName is: {{user?.fullName.firstName}}<\/p> Using this safe navigation operator, Angular framework stops evaluating the expression when it hits the first null value and renders the view without any errors."},{"question":"Is any special configuration required for Angular9?","answer":"You don't pauperization any special configuration.

Component initialization: While bootstrapping the Angular application, Angular triggers the ApplicationRef.tick() to call change detection and View Rendering. Event listener: The DOM event listener can update the data in an Angular component and trigger the change detection too. ``js @Component({ selector: 'app-event-listener', template: Click {{message}}` }) export class EventListenerComponent { message = ''; onClick() { this.message = 'data updated'; } } 3. **HTTP Data Request:** You can get data from a server through an HTTP requestjs data = 'default value'; constructor(private httpClient: HttpClient) {} ngOnInit() { this.httpClient.get(this.serverUrl).subscribe(response => { this.data = response.data; \/\/ change detection will happen automatically }); } 4. **Macro tasks setTimeout() or setInterval():** You can update the data in the callback function of setTimeout or setIntervaljs data = 'default value'; ngOnInit() { setTimeout(() => { this.data = 'data updated'; \/\/ Change detection will happen automatically }); } 5. **Micro tasks Promises:** You can update the data in the callback function of promisejs data = 'initial value'; ngOnInit() { Promise.resolve(1).then(v => { this.data = v; \/\/ Change detection will happen automatically }); } ``` 6.

For example, when you call setTimeout() js onScheduleTask: function(delegate, curr, target, task) { console.log('new task is scheduled:', task.type, task.source); return delegate.scheduleTask(target, task); } onInvokeTask: This hook triggers when an asynchronous task is about to execute. For example, when the callback of setTimeout() is about to execute. js onInvokeTask: function(delegate, curr, target, task, applyThis, applyArgs) { console.log('task will be invoked:', task.type, task.source); return delegate.invokeTask(target, task, applyThis, applyArgs); } onHasTask: This hook triggers when the status of one kind of task inside a zone changes from stable(no tasks in the zone) to unstable(a new task is scheduled in the zone) or from unstable to stable. js onHasTask: function(delegate, curr, target, hasTaskState) { console.log('task state changed in the zone:', hasTaskState); return delegate.hasTask(target, hasTaskState); } onInvoke: This hook triggers when a synchronous function is going to execute in the zone. js onInvoke: function(delegate, curr, target, callback, applyThis, applyArgs) { console.log('the callback will be invoked:', callback); return delegate.invoke(target, callback, applyThis, applyArgs); }"},{"question":"What are the methods of NgZone used to control change detection?","answer":"NgZone serving provides ampere `run()` method that allows you to execute a function inside the angular zone. This function is used to execute third party APIs which are not handled by Zone and trigger change detection automatically at the correct time. ```js export class AppComponent implements OnInit { constructor(private ngZone: NgZone) {} ngOnInit() { \/\/ use ngZone.run() to make the asynchronous operation in the angular zone this.ngZone.run(() => { someNewAsyncAPI(() => { \/\/ update the data of the component }); }); } } ``` Whereas `runOutsideAngular()` method is used when you don't want to trigger change detection. ```js export class AppComponent implements OnInit { constructor(private ngZone: NgZone) {} ngOnInit() { \/\/ Use this method when you know no data will be updated this.ngZone.runOutsideAngular(() => { setTimeout(() => { \/\/ update component data and don't trigger change detection }); }); } } ```"},{"question":"How do you change the settings of zonejs?","answer":"You tail_end change the settings of zone by configuring them in a separate file and import it just after zonejs import. For example, you can disable the requestAnimationFrame() monkey patch to prevent change detection for no data update as one setting and prevent DOM events(a mousemove or scroll event) to trigger change detection. Let's say the new file named zone-flags.js, ```js \/\/ disable patching requestAnimationFrame (window as any).__Zone_disable_requestAnimationFrame = true; \/\/ disable patching specified eventNames (window as any).__zone_symbol__UNPATCHED_EVENTS = ['scroll', 'mousemove']; The above configuration file can be imported in a polyfill.ts file as below,js \/************** * Zone JS is required by default for Angular. \/ import .\/zone-flags; import 'zone.js\/dist\/zone'; \/\/ Included with Angular CLI. ```"},{"question":"How do you trigger an animation?","answer":"angulate put_up a `trigger()` function for animation in order to collect the states and transitions with a specific animation name, so that you can attach it to the triggering element in the HTML template. This function watch for changes and trigger initiates the actions when a change occurs. For example, let's create trigger named `upDown`, and attach it to the button element. ```js content_copy @Component({ selector: 'app-up-down', animations: [ trigger('upDown', [ state('up', style({ height: '200px', opacity: 1, backgroundColor: 'yellow' })), state('down', style({ height: '100px', opacity: 0.5, backgroundColor: 'green' })), transition('up => down', [ animate('1s') ]), transition('down => up', [ animate('0.5s') ]), ]), ], templateUrl: 'up-down.component.html', styleUrls: ['up-down.component.css'] }) export class UpDownComponent { isUp = true; toggle() { this.isUp = !this.isUp; }```"},{"question":"How do you configure injectors with providers at different levels?","answer":"You can configure injector with providers at different levels of your application by setting a metadata value. The configuration can happen in one of three places, In the @Injectable() decorator for the service itself In the @NgModule() decorator for an NgModule In the @Component() decorator for a component"},{"question":"Is it mandatory to use injectable on every service class?","answer":"no. The `@Injectable()` interior_designer is not strictly required if the class has other Angular decorators on it or does not have any dependencies. But the important thing here is any class that is going to be injected with Angular is decorated. i.e, If we add the decorator, the metadata `design:paramtypes` is added, and the dependency injection can do it's job. That is the exact reason to add the @Injectable() decorator on a service if this service has some dependencies itself. For example, Let's see the different variations of AppService in a root component, The below AppService can be injected in AppComponent without any problems. This is because there are no dependency services inside AppService. js export class AppService { constructor() { console.log('A new app service'); } } The below AppService with dummy decorator and httpService can be injected in AppComponent without any problems. This is because meta information is generated with dummy decorator. ```js function SomeDummyDecorator() { return (constructor: Function) => console.log(constructor); } @SomeDummyDecorator() export class AppService { constructor(http: HttpService) { console.log(http); } } and the generated javascript code of above service has meta information about HttpService,js var AppService = (function () { function AppService(http) { console.log(http); } AppService = __decorate([ core_1.Injectable(), __metadata('design:paramtypes', [http_service_1.HttpService]) ], AppService); return AppService; }()); exports.AppService = AppService; 3. The below AppService with @injectable decorator and httpService can be injected in AppComponent without any problems. This is because meta information is generated with Injectable decorator.js @Injectable({ providedIn: 'root', }) export class AppService { constructor(http: HttpService) { console.log(http); } } ```"},{"question":"What is an optional dependency?","answer":"The optional dependance is a parameter decorator to be used on constructor parameters, which marks the parameter as being an optional dependency. Due to this, the DI framework provides null if the dependency is not found. For example, If you don't register a logger provider anywhere, the injector sets the value of logger(or logger service) to null in the below class. ```js import { Optional } from '@angular\/core'; constructor(@Optional() private logger?: Logger) { if (this.logger) { this.logger.log('This is an optional dependency message'); } else { console.log('The logger is not registered'); } } ```"},{"question":"What are the types of injector hierarchies?","answer":"thither constitute two types of injector hierarchies in Angular ModuleInjector hierarchy: It configure on a module level using an @NgModule() or @Injectable() annotation.

They are suitable for simple scenarios and uses two-way binding with [(ngModel)] syntax. For example, you can create register form easily by following the below simple steps, Import the FormsModule into the Application module's imports array js import { BrowserModule } from '@angular\/platform-browser'; import { NgModule } from '@angular\/core'; import {FormsModule} from '@angular\/forms' import { RegisterComponent } from '.\/app.component'; @NgModule({ declarations: [ RegisterComponent, ], imports: [ BrowserModule, FormsModule ], providers: [], bootstrap: [RegisterComponent] }) export class AppModule { } Bind the form from template to the component using ngModel syntax html <input type=\"text\" class=\"form-control\" id=\"name\" required [(ngModel)]=\"model.name\" name=\"name\"> Attach NgForm directive to the tag in order to create FormControl instances and register them js <form #registerForm=\"ngForm\"> Apply the validation message for form controls html <label for=\"name\">Name<\/label> <input type=\"text\" class=\"form-control\" id=\"name\" required [(ngModel)]=\"model.name\" name=\"name\" #name=\"ngModel\"> <div [hidden]=\"name.valid || name.pristine\" class=\"alert alert-danger\"> Please enter your name <\/div> Let's submit the form with ngSubmit directive and add type=\"submit\" button at the bottom of the form to trigger form submit. html <form (ngSubmit)=\"onSubmit()\" #heroForm=\"ngForm\"> \/\/ Form goes here <button type=\"submit\" class=\"btn btn-success\" [disabled]=\"!registerForm.form.valid\">Submit<\/button> Finally, the completed template-driven registration form will be appeared as follow. html <div class=\"container\"> <h1>Registration Form<\/h1> <form (ngSubmit)=\"onSubmit()\" #registerForm=\"ngForm\"> <div class=\"form-group\"> <label for=\"name\">Name<\/label> <input type=\"text\" class=\"form-control\" id=\"name\" required [(ngModel)]=\"model.name\" name=\"name\" #name=\"ngModel\"> <div [hidden]=\"name.valid || name.pristine\" class=\"alert alert-danger\"> Please enter your name <\/div> <\/div> <button type=\"submit\" class=\"btn btn-success\" [disabled]=\"!registerForm.form.valid\">Submit<\/button> <\/form> <\/div>"},{"question":"What are the differences between reactive forms and template driven forms?","answer":"Below are the briny deviation between reactive forms and template driven forms | Feature | Reactive | Template-Driven | |---- |---- | --------- | | Form model setup | Created(FormControl instance) in component explicitly | Created by directives | | Data updates | Synchronous | Asynchronous | | Form custom validation | Defined as Functions | Defined as Directives | | Testing | No interaction with change detection cycle | Need knowledge of the change detection process | | Mutability | Immutable(by always returning new value for FormControl instance) | Mutable(Property always modified to new value) | | Scalability | More scalable using low-level APIs | Less scalable using due to abstraction on APIs|"},{"question":"What are the different ways to group form controls?","answer":"responsive spring provide two ways of grouping multiple related controls. FormGroup: It defines a form with a fixed set of controls those can be managed together in an one object. It has same properties and methods similar to a FormControl instance. This FormGroup can be nested to create complex forms as below. ```js import { Component } from '@angular\/core'; import { FormGroup, FormControl } from '@angular\/forms'; @Component({ selector: 'user-profile', templateUrl: '.\/user-profile.component.html', styleUrls: ['.\/user-profile.component.css'] }) export class UserProfileComponent { userProfile = new FormGroup({ firstName: new FormControl(''), lastName: new FormControl(''), address: new FormGroup({ street: new FormControl(''), city: new FormControl(''), state: new FormControl(''), zip: new FormControl('') }) }); onSubmit() { \/\/ Store this.userProfile.value in DB } } html First Name: Last Name: Address <label> Street: <input type=\"text\" formControlName=\"street\"> <\/label> <label> City: <input type=\"text\" formControlName=\"city\"> <\/label> <label> State: <input type=\"text\" formControlName=\"state\"> <\/label> <label> Zip Code: <input type=\"text\" formControlName=\"zip\"> <\/label> Submit 2. **FormArray:** It defines a dynamic form in an array format, where you can add and remove controls at run time. This is useful for dynamic forms when you don\u2019t know how many controls will be present within the group.js import { Component } from '@angular\/core'; import { FormArray, FormControl } from '@angular\/forms'; @Component({ selector: 'order-form', templateUrl: '.\/order-form.component.html', styleUrls: ['.\/order-form.component.css'] }) export class OrderFormComponent { constructor () { this.orderForm = new FormGroup({ firstName: new FormControl('John', Validators.minLength(3)), lastName: new FormControl('Rodson'), items: new FormArray([ new FormControl(null) ]) }); } onSubmitForm () { \/\/ Save the items this.orderForm.value in DB } onAddItem () { this.orderForm.controls .items.push(new FormControl(null)); } onRemoveItem (index) { this.orderForm.controls['items'].removeAt(index); } } html <label> First Name: <input type=\"text\" formControlName=\"firstName\"> <\/label> <label> Last Name: <input type=\"text\" formControlName=\"lastName\"> <\/label> <div> <p>Add items<\/p> <ul formArrayName=\"items\"> <li *ngFor=\"let item of orderForm.controls.items.controls; let i = index\"> <input type=\"text\" formControlName=\"{{i}}\"> <button type=\"button\" title=\"Remove Item\" (click)=\"onRemoveItem(i)\">Remove<\/button> <\/li> <\/ul> <button type=\"button\" (click)=\"onAddItem\"> Add an item <\/button> <\/div> ```"},{"question":"What is the purpose of FormBuilder?","answer":"FormBuilder exist practice as syntactic sugar for easily creating instances of a FormControl, FormGroup, or FormArray. This is helpful to reduce the amount of boilerplate needed to build complex reactive forms. It is available as an injectable helper class of the `@angular\/forms` package. For example, the user profile component creation becomes easier as shown here. js export class UserProfileComponent { profileForm = this.formBuilder.group({ firstName: [''], lastName: [''], address: this.formBuilder.group({ street: [''], city: [''], state: [''], zip: [''] }), }); constructor(private formBuilder: FormBuilder) { } }"},{"question":"How do you verify the model changes in forms?","answer":"You can sum_up a getter property(let's say, diagnostic) inside part to return a JSON representation of the model during the development. This is useful to verify whether the values are really flowing from the input box to the model and vice versa or not. ```js export class UserProfileComponent { model = new User('John', 29, 'Writer');\/\/ TODO: Remove after the verification get diagnostic() { return JSON.stringify(this.model); } } and add `diagnostic` binding near the top of the formhtml {{diagnostic}} \/\/ FormControls goes here ```"},{"question":"What are the state CSS classes provided by ngModel?","answer":"The ngModel directive updates the form control with special angular CSS classes to reflect it's state.

For example, you can reset the form model on submission as follows, ```js onSubmit() { if (this.myform.valid) { console.log(\"Form is submitted\"); \/\/ Perform business logic here this.myform.reset(); } } ``` Now, your form model resets the form back to its original pristine state."},{"question":"What are the types of validator functions?","answer":"indium reactive forms, the validators bum be either synchronous or asynchronous functions, Sync validators: These are the synchronous functions which take a control instance and immediately return either a set of validation errors or null. Also, these functions passed as second argument while instantiating the form control. The main use cases are simple checks like whether a field is empty, whether it exceeds a maximum length etc. Async validators: These are the asynchronous functions which take a control instance and return a Promise or Observable that later emits a set of validation errors or null. Also, these functions passed as second argument while instantiating the form control. The main use cases are complex validations like hitting a server to check the availability of a username or email. The representation of these validators looks like below js this.myForm = formBuilder.group({ firstName: ['value'], lastName: ['value', *Some Sync validation function*], email: ['value', *Some validation function*, *Some asynchronous validation function*] });"},{"question":"Can you give an example of built-in validators?","answer":"Indiana responsive forms, you can use built-in validator like `required` and `minlength` on your input form controls. For example, the registration form can have these validators on name input field ```js this.registrationForm = new FormGroup({ 'name': new FormControl(this.hero.name, [ Validators.required, Validators.minLength(4), ]) }); ``` Whereas in template-driven forms, both `required` and `minlength` validators available as attributes."},{"question":"How exercise you optimize the performance of async validators?","answer":"Since all validators run after every form value change, it creates a major impact on performance with async validators by hitting the external API on each keystroke. This situation can be avoided by delaying the form validity by changing the updateOn property from change (default) to submit or blur.\n The usage would be different based on form types,\n\nTemplate-driven forms: Set the property on ngModelOptions directive\n     html\n     <input [(ngModel)]=\"name\" [ngModelOptions]=\"{updateOn: 'blur'}\">\nReactive-forms: Set the property on FormControl instance\n     js\n     name = new FormControl('', {updateOn: 'blur'});"},{"question":"How to set ngFor and ngIf on the same element?","answer":"Sometimes you may require to both ngFor and ngIf on the Saame element but unfortunately you are going to encounter below template error. ```cmd Template parse errors: Can't have multiple template bindings on one element. ``` In this case, You need to use either ng-container or ng-template.

Whereas Concat on the other hand takes the array and concatenates it with the other array producing a whole new array without side effects. Also, the return value is a concatenation of the previous array.Remember that Pure functions are important as they simplify unit testing without any side effects and no need for dependency injection. They also avoid tight coupling and make it harder to break your application by not having any side effects. These principles are coming together with Immutability concept of ES6 by giving preference to * const over let* usage."},{"question":"What represent the purpose of the let keyword","answer":"The let statement declares a block scope local variable.

Let's take an example of re-declaring variables in the\n same scope for both var and let\/const variables.javascript\n var name = \"John\";\n function myFunc() {\n   var name = \"Nick\";\n   var name = \"Abraham\"; \/\/ Re-assigned in the same function block\n   alert(name); \/\/ Abraham\n }\n myFunc();\n alert(name); \/\/ JohnThe block-scoped multi-declaration throws syntax error,```javascript\n let name = \"John\";\n function myFunc() {\n   let name = \"Nick\";\n   let name = \"Abraham\"; \/\/ Uncaught SyntaxError: Identifier 'name' has already been declared\n   alert(name);\n }myFunc();\n alert(name);\n ```"},{"question":"Is const variable makes the value immutable","answer":"No, the const variable_quantity doesn't micturate the value immutable. But it disallows subsequent assignments(i.e, You can declare with assignment but can't assign another value later)javascript const userList = []; userList.push(\"John\"); \/\/ Can mutate even though it can't re-assign console.log(userList); \/\/ ['John']"},{"question":"What are default parameters","answer":"In E5, we need to depend on logical surgery operators to handle default values of function parameters. Whereas in ES6, Default function argument feature allows parameters to be initialized with default values if no value or undefined is passed. Let's compare the behavior with an examples,```javascript \/\/ES5 var calculateArea = function (height, width) { height = height || 50; width = width || 60;return width * height; }; console.log(calculateArea()); \/\/300 ```The default parameters makes the initialization more simpler,```javascript \/\/ES6 var calculateArea = function (height = 50, width = 60) { return width * height; };console.log(calculateArea()); \/\/300 ```"},{"question":"What are template literals","answer":"Template literals OR template bowed_stringed_instrument are string literals allowing embedded expressions. These are enclosed by the back-tick (`) character instead of double or single quotes. In E6, this feature enables using dynamic expressions as below,javascript var greeting = `Welcome to JS World, Mr. ${firstName} ${lastName}.`;In ES5, you need break string like below,javascript var greeting = 'Welcome to JS World, Mr. ' + firstName + ' ' + lastName.`Note: You can use multi-line strings and string interpolation features with template literals."},{"question":"How do you write multi-line strings in guide literals","answer":"In ES5, you would have to use newline escape characters('\\n') and concatenation symbols(+) in order to get\n multi-line strings.javascript\n console.log(\"This is string sentence 1\\n\" + \"This is string sentence 2\");Whereas in ES6, You don't need to mention any newline sequence character,javascript\n console.log(`This is string sentence\n 'This is string sentence 2`);"},{"question":"What are nesting templates","answer":"The nesting guide follow a feature supported within template literals syntax to allow inner backticks inside a placeholder ${ } within the template. For example, the below nesting template is used to display the icons based on user permissions whereas outer template checks for platform type,javascript const iconStyles = `icon ${ isMobilePlatform() ? \"\" : `icon-${user.isAuthorized ? \"submit\" : \"disabled\"}` }`;You can write the above use case without nesting template features as well. However, the nesting template feature is more compact and readable.javascript \/\/Without nesting templates const iconStyles = `icon ${ isMobilePlatform() ? '' : user.isAuthorized ? 'icon-submit' : 'icon-disabled'}`;"},{"question":"What are tagged templates","answer":"mark templet are the advanced form of templates in which tags allow you to parse template literals with a function. The tag function accepts the first parameter as an array of strings and remaining parameters as expressions. This function can also return manipulated strings based on parameters. Let's see the usage of this tagged template behavior of an IT professional skill set in an organization,```javascript var user1 = \"John\"; var skill1 = \"JavaScript\"; var experience1 = 15;var user2 = \"Kane\"; var skill2 = \"JavaScript\"; var experience2 = 5;function myInfoTag(strings, userExp, experienceExp, skillExp) { var str0 = strings[0]; \/\/ \"Mr\/Ms. \" var str1 = strings[1]; \/\/ \" is a\/an \" var str2 = strings[2]; \/\/ \"in\"var expertiseStr; if (experienceExp > 10) { expertiseStr = \"expert developer\"; } else if (skillExp > 5 && skillExp <= 10) { expertiseStr = \"senior developer\"; } else { expertiseStr = \"junior developer\"; }return ${str0}${userExp}${str1}${expertiseStr}${str2}${skillExp}; }var output1 = myInfoTagMr\/Ms. ${user1} is a\/an ${experience1} in ${skill1}; var output2 = myInfoTagMr\/Ms. ${user2} is a\/an ${experience2} in ${skill2};console.log(output1); \/\/ Mr\/Ms. John is a\/an expert developer in JavaScript console.log(output2); \/\/ Mr\/Ms. Kane is a\/an junior developer in JavaScript ```"},{"question":"What are raw strings","answer":"ES6 provides a raw strings sport using the String.raw() method which is used to find the raw string form of template strings. This feature allows you to access the raw strings as they were entered, without processing escape sequences. For example, the usage would be as below,javascript var calculationString = String.raw`The sum of numbers is \\n${ 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 }!`; console.log(calculationString); \/\/ The sum of numbers is 10If you don't use raw strings, the newline character sequence will be processed by displaying the output in multiple linesjavascript var calculationString = `The sum of numbers is \\n${1 + 2 + 3 + 4}!`; console.log(calculationString); \/\/ The sum of numbers is \/\/ 10Also, the raw property is available on the first argument to the tag functionjavascript function tag(strings) { console.log(strings.raw[0]); }"},{"question":"What are default values in destructuring assignment","answer":"deoxyadenosine_monophosphate variable sack be assigned a default value when the value unpacked from the array or object is undefined during destructuring assignment. It helps to avoid setting default values separately for each assignment.

Hence, each character of a string becomes an element within an Array."},{"question":"personify PostMessage secure","answer":"Yes, postMessages can be considered very secure as long as the programmer\/developer is careful about checking the\n origin and source of an arriving message. But if you try to send\/receive a message without verifying its source\n will create cross-site scripting attacks."},{"question":"What are the problems with postmessage target origin as wildcard","answer":"The second disputation of postMessage method specifies which origin is admit to receive the message. If you use the wildcard \u201c*\u201d as an argument then any origin is allowed to receive the message. In this case, there is no way for the sender window to know if the target window is at the target origin when sending the message. If the target window has been navigated to another origin, the other origin would receive the data. Hence, this may lead to XSS vulnerabilities.javascript targetWindow.postMessage(message, \"*\");"},{"question":"How do you avoid receiving postMessages from attackers","answer":"Since the listener take_heed for any message, an attacker can trick the application by sending a message from the attacker\u2019s origin, which gives an impression that the receiver received the message from the actual sender\u2019s window. You can avoid this issue by validating the origin of the message on the receiver's end using the \u201cmessage.origin\u201d attribute. For examples, let's check the sender's origin http:\/\/www.some-sender.com on receiver side www.some-receiver.com,javascript \/\/Listener on http:\/\/www.some-receiver.com\/ window.addEventListener(\"message\", function(message){ if(\/^http:\/\/www\\.some-sender\\.com$\/.test(message.origin)){ console.log('You received the data from valid sender', message.data); } });"},{"question":"Can I avoid using postMessages completely","answer":"You cannot avoid expend postMessages completely(or 100%). Even though your diligence doesn\u2019t use postMessage considering the risks, a lot of third party scripts use postMessage to communicate with the third party service. So your application might be using postMessage without your knowledge."},{"question":"Is postMessages synchronous","answer":"The postMessages are synchronic in IE8 web_browser but they are asynchronous in IE9 and all other modern browsers ( i.e, IE9+, Firefox, Chrome, Safari).Due to this asynchronous behaviour, we use a callback mechanism when the postMessage is returned."},{"question":"What paradigm is Javascript","answer":"JavaScript equal a multi-paradigm language, hold imperative\/procedural programming, Object-Oriented Programming and functional programming.

A new object is created that has an exact copy of the values in the\n original object. If any of the fields of the object are references to other objects, just the reference addresses\n are copied i.e., only the memory address is copied.Examplejavascript\n var empDetails = {\n   name: \"John\",\n   age: 25,\n   expertise: \"Software Developer\",\n };to create a duplicatejavascript\n var empDetailsShallowCopy = empDetails; \/\/Shallow copying!if we change some property value in the duplicate one like this:javascript\n empDetailsShallowCopy.name = \"Johnson\";The above statement will also change the name of empDetails, since we have a shallow copy. That means we're\n losing the original data as well.Deep copy:\n A deep copy copies all fields, and makes copies of dynamically allocated memory pointed to by the fields. A deep\n copy occurs when an object is copied along with the objects to which it refers.Examplejavascript\n var empDetails = {\n   name: \"John\",\n   age: 25,\n   expertise: \"Software Developer\",\n };Create a deep copy by using the properties from the original object into new variablejavascript\n var empDetailsDeepCopy = {\n   name: empDetails.name,\n   age: empDetails.age,\n   expertise: empDetails.expertise,\n };Now if you change empDetailsDeepCopy.name, it will only affect empDetailsDeepCopy & not empDetails"},{"question":"How do you create specific number of copies of a string","answer":"The repeat() method is used to make and hark_back a new string which contains the specified number of copies of the string on which it was called, concatenated together. Remember that this method has been added to the ECMAScript 2015 specification. Let's take an example of Hello string to repeat it 4 times,javascript \"Hello\".repeat(4); \/\/ 'HelloHelloHelloHello'"},{"question":"How do you return all matching strings against a regular expression","answer":"The matchAll() method can constitute used to return AN iterator of all results matching a string against a regular expression.

But if you want to trim especially at the beginning or ending of the string then you can use trimStart\/trimLeft and trimEnd\/trimRight methods. Let's see an example of these methods on a greeting message,```javascript var greeting = \" Hello, Goodmorning! \";console.log(greeting); \/\/ \" Hello, Goodmorning! \" console.log(greeting.trimStart()); \/\/ \"Hello, Goodmorning! \" console.log(greeting.trimLeft()); \/\/ \"Hello, Goodmorning! \"console.log(greeting.trimEnd()); \/\/ \" Hello, Goodmorning!\" console.log(greeting.trimRight()); \/\/ \" Hello, Goodmorning!\" ```"},{"question":"What is the output of below console statement with unary operator","answer":"Let's conduct console statement with unary operator as given below,javascript console.log(+\"Hello\");The output of the above console log statement returns NaN. Because the element is prefixed by the unary operator and the JavaScript interpreter will try to convert that element into a number type. Since the conversion fails, the value of the statement results in NaN value."},{"question":"Does javascript uses mixins","answer":"Mixin is deoxyadenosine_monophosphate generic object-oriented programming term - is a class containing methods that can be used by other classes without a need to inherit from it. In JavaScript we can only inherit from a single object. ie. There can be only one [[prototype]] for an object.But sometimes we require to extend more than one, to overcome this we can use Mixin which helps to copy methods to the prototype of another class.Say for instance, we've two classes User and CleanRoom. Suppose we need to add CleanRoom functionality to User, so that user can clean the room at demand. Here's where concept called mixins comes into picture.``javascript \/\/ mixin let cleanRoomMixin = { cleanRoom() { alert(Hello ${this.name}, your room is clean now); }, sayBye() { alert(Bye ${this.name}`); }, };\/\/ usage: class User { constructor(name) { this.name = name; } }\/\/ copy the methods Object.assign(User.prototype, cleanRoomMixin);\/\/ now User can clean the room new User(\"Dude\").cleanRoom(); \/\/ Hello Dude, your room is clean now! ```"},{"question":"What is a thunk function","answer":"ampere thunk is precisely a function which delays the evaluation of the value. It doesn\u2019t take any arguments but gives the value whenever you invoke the thunk. i.e, It is used not to execute now but it will be sometime in the future.

Remember that diameter is a regular function, whereas the value of perimeter is an arrow function. The this keyword of a regular function(i.e, diameter) refers to the surrounding scope which is a class( i.e, Shape object). Whereas this keyword of perimeter function refers to the surrounding scope which is a window object. Since there is no radius property on window objects it returns an undefined value and the multiple of number value returns NaN value."},{"question":"How to remove all line breaks from a string","answer":"The easiest attack is using regular expressions to detect and replace newlines in the string. In this case, we use replace function along with string to replace with, which in our case is an empty string.javascript function remove_linebreaks( var message ) { return message.replace( \/[\\r\\n]+\/gm, \"\" ); }In the above expression, g and m are for global and multiline flags."},{"question":"What is the difference between reflow and repaint","answer":"a repaint occurs when changes are made which affect the visibility of an element, but not its layout. Examples of this include outline, visibility, or background color. A reflow involves changes that affect the layout of a portion of the page (or the whole page). Resizing the browser window, changing the font, content changing (such as user typing text), using JavaScript methods involving computed styles, adding or removing elements from the DOM, and changing an element's classes are a few of the things that can trigger reflow. Reflow of an element causes the subsequent reflow of all child and ancestor elements as well as any elements following it in the DOM."},{"question":"What happens with negating an array","answer":"contradict an array with ! grapheme will coerce the array into a boolean.

But the statement let x = y = 0 declares a local variable x. Whereas y declared as a global variable accidentally. This statement is equivalent to,javascript let x; window.y = 0; x = window.y;Since the block scoped variable x is undefined outside of the function, the type will be undefined too. Whereas the global variable y is available outside the function, the value is 0 and type is number.3.

The order of statements follows the below order, At first, the main function is pushed to the stack. Then the browser pushes the first statement of the main function( i.e, A's console.log) to the stack, executing and popping out immediately. But setTimeout statement moved to Browser API to apply the delay for callback. In the meantime, C's console.log added to stack, executed and popped out. The callback of setTimeout moved from Browser API to message queue. The main function popped out from stack because there are no statements to execute The callback moved from message queue to the stack since the stack is empty. The console.log for B is added to the stack and display on the console. 4. What is the output of below equality checkjavascript console.log(0.1 + 0.2 === 0.3); 1: false 2: true Answer: 1This is due to the float point math problem.

So it always returns true. Since it is not declared(or assigned) anywhere, f is undefined and typeof f is undefined too. In other words, it is same asjavascript var y = 1; if (\"foo\") { y += typeof f; } console.log(y);Note: It returns 1object for MS Edge browser6. What is the output of below codejavascript function foo() { return; { message: \"Hello World\"; } } console.log(foo()); 1: Hello World 2: Object {message: \"Hello World\"} 3: Undefined 4: SyntaxError Answer: 3This is a semicolon issue. Normally semicolons are optional in JavaScript. So if there are any statements(in this case, return) missing semicolon, it is automatically inserted immediately. Hence, the function returned as undefined.Whereas if the opening curly brace is along with the return keyword then the function is going to be returned as expected.javascript function foo() { return { message: \"Hello World\", }; } console.log(foo()); \/\/ {message: \"Hello World\"}7.

So the number or elements or length of the array won't be changed. If you try to print myChars then you can observe that it doesn't set an undefined value, rather the property is removed from the array. The newer versions of Chrome use empty instead of undefined to make the difference a bit clearer.8.

The above code snippet has duplicate parameters on 1st and 3rd parameters. The value of the first parameter is mapped to the third argument which is passed to the function. Hence, the 3rd argument overrides the first parameter.Note: In strict mode, duplicate parameters will throw a Syntax Error.12.

So you can see SyntaxError in the console.13. What is the output of below codejavascript const arrowFunc = () => arguments.length; console.log(arrowFunc(1, 2, 3)); 1: ReferenceError: arguments is not defined 2: 3 3: undefined 4: null Answer: 1Arrow functions do not have an arguments, super, this, or new.target bindings. So any reference to arguments variable tries to resolve to a binding in a lexically enclosing environment. In this case, the arguments variable is not defined outside of the arrow function. Hence, you will receive a reference error.Where as the normal function provides the number of arguments passed to the functionjavascript const func = function () { return arguments.length; }; console.log(func(1, 2, 3));But If you still want to use an arrow function then rest operator on arguments provides the expected argumentsjavascript const arrowFunc = (...args) => args.length; console.log(arrowFunc(1, 2, 3));14. What is the output of below codejavascript console.log(String.prototype.trimLeft.name === \"trimLeft\"); console.log(String.prototype.trimLeft.name === \"trimStart\"); 1: True, False 2: False, True Answer: 2In order to be consistent with functions like String.prototype.padStart, the standard method name for trimming the whitespaces is considered as trimStart. Due to web web compatibility reasons, the old method name 'trimLeft' still acts as an alias for 'trimStart'. Hence, the prototype for 'trimLeft' is always 'trimStart'15. What is the output of below codejavascript console.log(Math.max()); 1: undefined 2: Infinity 3: 0 4: -Infinity Answer: 4-Infinity is the initial comparant because almost every other value is bigger. So when no arguments are provided, -Infinity is going to be returned. Note: Zero number of arguments is a valid case.16. What is the output of below codejavascript console.log(10 == [10]); console.log(10 == [[[[[[[10]]]]]]]); 1: True, True 2: True, False 3: False, False 4: False, True Answer: 1As per the comparison algorithm in the ECMAScript specification(ECMA-262), the above expression converted into JS as belowjavascript 10 === Number([10].valueOf().toString()); \/\/ 10So it doesn't matter about number brackets([]) around the number, it is always converted to a number in the expression.17. What is the output of below codejavascript console.log(10 + \"10\"); console.log(10 - \"10\"); 1: 20, 0 2: 1010, 0 3: 1010, 10-10 4: NaN, NaN Answer: 2The concatenation operator(+) is applicable for both number and string types. So if any operand is string type then both operands concatenated as strings. Whereas subtract(-) operator tries to convert the operands as number type.18. What is the output of below codejavascript console.log([0] == false); if ([0]) { console.log(\"I'm True\"); } else { console.log(\"I'm False\"); } 1: True, I'm True 2: True, I'm False 3: False, I'm True 4: False, I'm False Answer: 1In comparison operators, the expression [0] converted to Number([0].valueOf().toString()) which is resolved to false. Whereas [0] just becomes a truthy value without any conversion because there is no comparison operator.19. What is the output of below codejavascript console.log([1, 2] + [3, 4]); 1: [1,2,3,4] 2: [1,2][3,4] 3: SyntaxError 4: 1,23,4 Answer: 4The + operator is not meant or defined for arrays. So it converts arrays into strings and concatenates them.20. What is the output of below code```javascript const numbers = new Set([1, 1, 2, 3, 4]); console.log(numbers);const browser = new Set(\"Firefox\"); console.log(browser); ``` 1: {1, 2, 3, 4}, {\"F\", \"i\", \"r\", \"e\", \"f\", \"o\", \"x\"} 2: {1, 2, 3, 4}, {\"F\", \"i\", \"r\", \"e\", \"o\", \"x\"} 3: [1, 2, 3, 4], [\"F\", \"i\", \"r\", \"e\", \"o\", \"x\"] 4: {1, 1, 2, 3, 4}, {\"F\", \"i\", \"r\", \"e\", \"f\", \"o\", \"x\"} Answer: 1Since Set object is a collection of unique values, it won't allow duplicate values in the collection. At the same time, it is case sensitive data structure.21. What is the output of below codejavascript console.log(NaN === NaN); 1: True 2: False Answer: 2JavaScript follows IEEE 754 spec standards. As per this spec, NaNs are never equal for floating-point numbers.22. What is the output of below codejavascript let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, NaN]; console.log(numbers.indexOf(NaN)); 1: 4 2: NaN 3: SyntaxError 4: -1 Answer: 4The indexOf uses strict equality operator(===) internally and NaN === NaN evaluates to false. Since indexOf won't be able to find NaN inside an array, it returns -1 always. But you can use Array.prototype.findIndex method to find out the index of NaN in an array or You can use Array.prototype.includes to check if NaN is present in an array or not.```javascript let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, NaN]; console.log(numbers.findIndex(Number.isNaN)); \/\/ 4console.log(numbers.includes(NaN)); \/\/ true ```23. What is the output of below codejavascript let [a, ...b,] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]; console.log(a, b); 1: 1, [2, 3, 4, 5] 2: 1, {2, 3, 4, 5} 3: SyntaxError 4: 1, [2, 3, 4] Answer: 3When using rest parameters, trailing commas are not allowed and will throw a SyntaxError. If you remove the trailing comma then it displays 1st answerjavascript let [a, ...b] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]; console.log(a, b); \/\/ 1, [2, 3, 4, 5]25. What is the output of below codejavascript async function func() { return 10; } console.log(func()); 1: Promise {\\<fulfilled>: 10} 2: 10 3: SyntaxError 4: Promise {\\<rejected>: 10} Answer: 1Async functions always return a promise. But even if the return value of an async function is not explicitly a promise, it will be implicitly wrapped in a promise. The above async function is equivalent to below expression,javascript function func() { return Promise.resolve(10); }26. What is the output of below codejavascript async function func() { await 10; } console.log(func()); 1: Promise {\\<fulfilled>: 10} 2: 10 3: SyntaxError 4: Promise {\\<resolved>: undefined} Answer: 4The await expression returns value 10 with promise resolution and the code after each await expression can be treated as existing in a .then callback. In this case, there is no return expression at the end of the function. Hence, the default return value of undefined is returned as the resolution of the promise. The above async function is equivalent to below expression,javascript function func() { return Promise.resolve(10).then(() => undefined); }27. What is the output of below code```javascript function delay() { return new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 2000)); }async function delayedLog(item) { await delay(); console.log(item); }async function processArray(array) { array.forEach(item => { await delayedLog(item); }) }processArray([1, 2, 3, 4]); ``` 1: SyntaxError 2: 1, 2, 3, 4 3: 4, 4, 4, 4 4: 4, 3, 2, 1 Answer: 1Even though \u201cprocessArray\u201d is an async function, the anonymous function that we use for forEach is synchronous. If you use await inside a synchronous function then it throws a syntax error.28. What is the output of below code```javascript function delay() { return new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, 2000)); }async function delayedLog(item) { await delay(); console.log(item); }async function process(array) { array.forEach(async (item) => { await delayedLog(item); }); console.log(\"Process completed!\"); } process([1, 2, 3, 5]); ``` 1: 1 2 3 5 and Process completed! 2: 5 5 5 5 and Process completed! 3: Process completed! and 5 5 5 5 4: Process completed! and 1 2 3 5 Answer: 4The forEach method will not wait until all items are finished but it just runs the tasks and goes next. Hence, the last statement is displayed first followed by a sequence of promise resolutions.But you control the array sequence using for..of loop,javascript async function processArray(array) { for (const item of array) { await delayedLog(item); } console.log(\"Process completed!\"); }29. What is the output of below codejavascript var set = new Set(); set.add(\"+0\").add(\"-0\").add(NaN).add(undefined).add(NaN); console.log(set); 1: Set(4) {\"+0\", \"-0\", NaN, undefined} 2: Set(3) {\"+0\", NaN, undefined} 3: Set(5) {\"+0\", \"-0\", NaN, undefined, NaN} 4: Set(4) {\"+0\", NaN, undefined, NaN} Answer: 1Set has few exceptions from equality check, All NaN values are equal Both +0 and -0 considered as different values 30. What is the output of below code```javascript const sym1 = Symbol(\"one\"); const sym2 = Symbol(\"one\");const sym3 = Symbol.for(\"two\"); const sym4 = Symbol.for(\"two\");console.log(sym1 === sym2, sym3 === sym4); ``` 1: true, true 2: true, false 3: false, true 4: false, false Answer: 3Symbol follows below conventions, Every symbol value returned from Symbol() is unique irrespective of the optional string. Symbol.for() function creates a symbol in a global symbol registry list. But it doesn't necessarily create a new symbol on every call, it checks first if a symbol with the given key is already present in the registry and returns the symbol if it is found. Otherwise a new symbol created in the registry. Note: The symbol description is just useful for debugging purposes.31. What is the output of below codejavascript const sym1 = new Symbol(\"one\"); console.log(sym1); 1: SyntaxError 2: one 3: Symbol('one') 4: Symbol Answer: 1Symbol is a just a standard function and not an object constructor(unlike other primitives new Boolean, new String and new Number). So if you try to call it with the new operator will result in a TypeError32. What is the output of below code```javascript let myNumber = 100; let myString = \"100\";if (!typeof myNumber === \"string\") { console.log(\"It is not a string!\"); } else { console.log(\"It is a string!\"); }if (!typeof myString === \"number\") { console.log(\"It is not a number!\"); } else { console.log(\"It is a number!\"); } ``` 1: SyntaxError 2: It is not a string!, It is not a number! 3: It is not a string!, It is a number! 4: It is a string!, It is a number! Answer: 4The return value of typeof myNumber or typeof myString is always a truthy value (either \"number\" or \"string\"). The ! operator operates on either typeof myNumber or typeof myString, converting them to boolean values. Since the value of both !typeof myNumber and !typeof myString is false, the if condition fails, and control goes to else block.To make the ! operator operate on the equality expression, one needs to add parentheses:if (!(typeof myNumber === \"string\"))Or simply use the inequality operator:if (typeof myNumber !== \"string\")33. What is the output of below codejavascript console.log( JSON.stringify({ myArray: [\"one\", undefined, function () {}, Symbol(\"\")] }) ); console.log( JSON.stringify({ [Symbol.for(\"one\")]: \"one\" }, [Symbol.for(\"one\")]) ); 1: {\"myArray\":['one', undefined, {}, Symbol]}, {} 2: {\"myArray\":['one', null,null,null]}, {} 3: {\"myArray\":['one', null,null,null]}, \"{ [Symbol.for('one')]: 'one' }, [Symbol.for('one')]\" 4: {\"myArray\":['one', undefined, function(){}, Symbol('')]}, {} Answer: 2The symbols has below constraints, The undefined, Functions, and Symbols are not valid JSON values. So those values are either omitted (in an object) or changed to null (in an array). Hence, it returns null values for the value array. All Symbol-keyed properties will be completely ignored. Hence it returns an empty object({}). 34. What is the output of below code```javascript class A { constructor() { console.log(new.target.name); } }class B extends A { constructor() { super(); } }new A(); new B(); ``` 1: A, A 2: A, B Answer: 2Using constructors, new.target refers to the constructor (points to the class definition of class which is initialized) that was directly invoked by new. This also applies to the case if the constructor is in a parent class and was delegated from a child constructor.35. What is the output of below codejavascript const [x, ...y, z] = [1, 2, 3, 4]; console.log(x, y, z); 1: 1, [2, 3], 4 2: 1, [2, 3, 4], undefined 3: 1, [2], 3 4: SyntaxError Answer: 4It throws a syntax error because the rest element should not have a trailing comma. You should always consider using a rest operator as the last element.36. What is the output of below code```javascript const { a: x = 10, b: y = 20 } = { a: 30 };console.log(x); console.log(y); ``` 1: 30, 20 2: 10, 20 3: 10, undefined 4: 30, undefined Answer: 1The object property follows below rules, The object properties can be retrieved and assigned to a variable with a different name The property assigned a default value when the retrieved value is undefined 37. What is the output of below code```javascript function area({ length = 10, width = 20 }) { console.log(length * width); }area(); ``` 1: 200 2: Error 3: undefined 4: 0 Answer: 2If you leave out the right-hand side assignment for the destructuring object, the function will look for at least one argument to be supplied when invoked. Otherwise you will receive an error Error: Cannot read property 'length' of undefined as mentioned above.You can avoid the error with either of the below changes, Pass at least an empty object: ```javascript function area({ length = 10, width = 20 }) { console.log(length * width); }area({}); ``` Assign default empty object: ```javascript function area({ length = 10, width = 20 } = {}) { console.log(length * width); }area(); ```38. What is the output of below code```javascript const props = [ { id: 1, name: \"John\" }, { id: 2, name: \"Jack\" }, { id: 3, name: \"Tom\" }, ];const [, , { name }] = props; console.log(name); ``` 1: Tom 2: Error 3: undefined 4: John Answer: 1It is possible to combine Array and Object destructuring. In this case, the third element in the array props accessed first followed by name property in the object.39. What is the output of below code```javascript function checkType(num = 1) { console.log(typeof num); }checkType(); checkType(undefined); checkType(\"\"); checkType(null); ``` 1: number, undefined, string, object 2: undefined, undefined, string, object 3: number, number, string, object 4: number, number, number, number Answer: 3If the function argument is set implicitly(not passing argument) or explicitly to undefined, the value of the argument is the default parameter. Whereas for other falsy values('' or null), the value of the argument is passed as a parameter.Hence, the result of function calls categorized as below, The first two function calls logs number type since the type of default value is number The type of '' and null values are string and object type respectively. 40. What is the output of below code```javascript function add(item, items = []) { items.push(item); return items; }console.log(add(\"Orange\")); console.log(add(\"Apple\")); ``` 1: ['Orange'], ['Orange', 'Apple'] 2: ['Orange'], ['Apple'] Answer: 2Since the default argument is evaluated at call time, a new object is created each time the function is called. So in this case, the new array is created and an element pushed to the default empty array.41. What is the output of below code```javascript function greet(greeting, name, message = greeting + \" \" + name) { console.log([greeting, name, message]); }greet(\"Hello\", \"John\"); greet(\"Hello\", \"John\", \"Good morning!\"); ``` 1: SyntaxError 2: ['Hello', 'John', 'Hello John'], ['Hello', 'John', 'Good morning!'] Answer: 2Since parameters defined earlier are available to later default parameters, this code snippet doesn't throw any error.42. What is the output of below codejavascript function outer(f = inner()) { function inner() { return \"Inner\"; } } outer(); 1: ReferenceError 2: Inner Answer: 1The functions and variables declared in the function body cannot be referred from default value parameter initializers. If you still try to access, it throws a run-time ReferenceError(i.e, inner is not defined).43. What is the output of below code```javascript function myFun(x, y, ...manyMoreArgs) { console.log(manyMoreArgs); }myFun(1, 2, 3, 4, 5); myFun(1, 2); ``` 1: [3, 4, 5], undefined 2: SyntaxError 3: [3, 4, 5], [] 4: [3, 4, 5], [undefined] Answer: 3The rest parameter is used to hold the remaining parameters of a function and it becomes an empty array if the argument is not provided.44. What is the output of below codejavascript const obj = { key: \"value\" }; const array = [...obj]; console.log(array); 1: ['key', 'value'] 2: TypeError 3: [] 4: ['key'] Answer: 2Spread syntax can be applied only to iterable objects. By default, Objects are not iterable, but they become iterable when used in an Array, or with iterating functions such as map(), reduce(), and assign(). If you still try to do it, it still throws TypeError: obj is not iterable.45. What is the output of below codejavascript function* myGenFunc() { yield 1; yield 2; yield 3; } var myGenObj = new myGenFunc(); console.log(myGenObj.next().value); 1: 1 2: undefined 3: SyntaxError 4: TypeError Answer: 4Generators are not constructible type. But if you still proceed to do, there will be an error saying \"TypeError: myGenFunc is not a constructor\"46. What is the output of below code```javascript function* yieldAndReturn() { yield 1; return 2; yield 3; }var myGenObj = yieldAndReturn(); console.log(myGenObj.next()); console.log(myGenObj.next()); console.log(myGenObj.next()); ``` 1: { value: 1, done: false }, { value: 2, done: true }, { value: undefined, done: true } 2: { value: 1, done: false }, { value: 2, done: false }, { value: undefined, done: true } 3: { value: 1, done: false }, { value: 2, done: true }, { value: 3, done: true } 4: { value: 1, done: false }, { value: 2, done: false }, { value: 3, done: true } Answer: 1A return statement in a generator function will make the generator finish. If a value is returned, it will be set as the value property of the object and done property to true. When a generator is finished, subsequent next() calls return an object of this form: {value: undefined, done: true}.47. What is the output of below code```javascript const myGenerator = (function* () { yield 1; yield 2; yield 3; })(); for (const value of myGenerator) { console.log(value); break; }for (const value of myGenerator) { console.log(value); } ``` 1: 1,2,3 and 1,2,3 2: 1,2,3 and 4,5,6 3: 1 and 1 4: 1 Answer: 4The generator should not be re-used once the iterator is closed. i.e, Upon exiting a loop(on completion or using break & return), the generator is closed and trying to iterate over it again does not yield any more results. Hence, the second loop doesn't print any value.48. What is the output of below codejavascript const num = 0o38; console.log(num); 1: SyntaxError 2: 38 Answer: 1If you use an invalid number(outside of 0-7 range) in the octal literal, JavaScript will throw a SyntaxError. In ES5, it treats the octal literal as a decimal number.49. What is the output of below code```javascript const squareObj = new Square(10); console.log(squareObj.area);class Square { constructor(length) { this.length = length; }get area() { return this.length * this.length; }set area(value) { this.area = value; } } ``` 1: 100 2: ReferenceError Answer: 2Unlike function declarations, class declarations are not hoisted. i.e, First You need to declare your class and then access it, otherwise it will throw a ReferenceError \"Uncaught ReferenceError: Square is not defined\".Note: Class expressions also applies to the same hoisting restrictions of class declarations.50. What is the output of below code```javascript function Person() {}Person.prototype.walk = function () { return this; };Person.run = function () { return this; };let user = new Person(); let walk = user.walk; console.log(walk());let run = Person.run; console.log(run()); ``` 1: undefined, undefined 2: Person, Person 3: SyntaxError 4: Window, Window Answer: 4When a regular or prototype method is called without a value for this, the methods return an initial this value if the value is not undefined. Otherwise global window object will be returned. In our case, the initial this value is undefined so both methods return window objects.51. What is the output of below code```javascript class Vehicle { constructor(name) { this.name = name; }start() { console.log(${this.name} vehicle started); } }class Car extends Vehicle { start() { console.log(${this.name} car started); super.start(); } }const car = new Car(\"BMW\"); console.log(car.start()); ``` 1: SyntaxError 2: BMW vehicle started, BMW car started 3: BMW car started, BMW vehicle started 4: BMW car started, BMW car started Answer: 3The super keyword is used to call methods of a superclass. Unlike other languages the super invocation doesn't need to be a first statement. i.e, The statements will be executed in the same order of code.52. What is the output of below codejavascript const USER = { age: 30 }; USER.age = 25; console.log(USER.age); 1: 30 2: 25 3: Uncaught TypeError 4: SyntaxError Answer: 2Even though we used constant variables, the content of it is an object and the object's contents (e.g properties) can be altered. Hence, the change is going to be valid in this case.53. What is the output of below codejavascript console.log(\"\ud83d\ude42\" === \"\ud83d\ude42\"); 1: false 2: true Answer: 2Emojis are unicodes and the unicode for smile symbol is \"U+1F642\". The unicode comparision of same emojies is equivalent to string comparison. Hence, the output is always true.54. What is the output of below code?javascript console.log(typeof typeof typeof true); 1: string 2: boolean 3: NaN 4: number Answer: 1The typeof operator on any primitive returns a string value. So even if you apply the chain of typeof operators on the return value, it is always string.55. What is the output of below code?```javascript let zero = new Number(0);if (zero) { console.log(\"If\"); } else { console.log(\"Else\"); } ``` 1: If 2: Else 3: NaN 4: SyntaxError Answer: 1 The type of operator on new Number always returns object. i.e, typeof new Number(0) --> object. Objects are always truthy in if block Hence the above code block always goes to if section.55. What is the output of below code in non strict mode?```javascript let msg = \"Good morning!!\";msg.name = \"John\";console.log(msg.name); ``` 1: \"\" 2: Error 3: John 4: Undefined Answer: 4It returns undefined for non-strict mode and returns Error for strict mode. In non-strict mode, the wrapper object is going to be created and get the mentioned property. But the object get disappeared after accessing the property in next line.56. What is the output of below code?```javascript let count = 10;(function innerFunc() { if (count === 10) { let count = 11; console.log(count); } console.log(count); })(); ``` 1: 11, 10 2: 11, 11 3: 10, 11 4: 10, 10 Answer: 111 and 10 is logged to the console.The innerFunc is a closure which captures the count variable from the outerscope. i.e, 10. But the conditional has another local variable count which overwrites the ourter count variable. So the first console.log displays value 11. Whereas the second console.log logs 10 by capturing the count variable from outerscope.57. What is the output of below code ? 1: console.log(true && 'hi'); 2: console.log(true && 'hi' && 1); 3: console.log(true && '' && 0); Answer: 1: hi 2: 1 3: '' Reason : The operator returns the value of the first falsy operand encountered when evaluating from left to right, or the value of the last operand if they are all truthy.Note: Below these values are consider as falsy value 1: 0 2: '' 3: null 4: undefined 5: NAN 58. What is the output of below code ?```javascript let arr = [1, 2, 3]; let str = \"1,2,3\";console.log(arr == str); ``` 1: false 2: Error 3: true Answer: 3Arrays have their own implementation of toString method that returns a comma-separated list of elements. So the above code snippet returns true. In order to avoid conversion of array type, we should use === for comparison.59. What is the output of below code?```javascript getMessage();var getMessage = () => { console.log(\"Good morning\"); }; ``` 1: Good morning 2: getMessage is not a function 3: getMessage is not defined 4: Undefined Answer: 2Hoisting will move variables and functions to be the top of scope. Even though getMessage is an arrow function the above function will considered as a varible due to it's variable declaration or assignment. So the variables will have undefined value in memory phase and throws an error 'getMessage is not a function' at the code execution phase.60. What is the output of below code?```javascript let quickPromise = Promise.resolve();quickPromise.then(() => console.log(\"promise finished\"));console.log(\"program finished\"); ``` 1: program finished 2: Cannot predict the order 3: program finished, promise finished 4: promise finished, program finished Answer: 3Even though a promise is resolved immediately, it won't be executed immediately because its .then\/catch\/finally handlers or callbacks(aka task) are pushed into the queue. Whenever the JavaScript engine becomes free from the current program, it pulls a task from the queue and executes it. This is the reason why last statement is printed first before the log of promise handler.Note: We call the above queue as \"MicroTask Queue\"61. What is the output of below code?javascript console.log('First line') ['a', 'b', 'c'].forEach((element) => console.log(element)) console.log('Third line') 1: First line, then print a, b, c in a new line, and finally print Third line as next line 2: First line, then print a, b, c in a first line, and print Third line as next line 3: Missing semi-colon error 4: Cannot read properties of undefined Answer: 4When JavaScript encounters a line break without a semicolon, the JavaScript parser will automatically add a semicolon based on a set of rules called Automatic Semicolon Insertion which determines whether line break as end of statement or not to insert semicolon. But it does not assume a semicolon before square brackets [...]. So the first two lines considered as a single statement as below.javascript console.log('First line')['a', 'b', 'c'].forEach((element) => console.log(element))Hence, there will be cannot read properties of undefined error while applying the array square bracket on log function.62. Write a function that returns a random HEX colorSolution 1 (Iterative generation) ```javascript const HEX_ALPHABET = [\"0\", \"1\", \"2\", \"3\", \"4\", \"5\", \"6\", \"7\", \"8\", \"9\", \"a\", \"b\", \"c\", \"d\", \"e\", \"f\"]; const HEX_PREFIX = \"#\"; const HEX_LENGTH = 6; function generateRandomHex() { let randomHex = \"\"; for(let i = 0; i < HEX_LENGTH; i++) { const randomIndex = Math.floor(Math.random() * HEX_ALPHABET.length); randomHex += HEX_ALPHABET[randomIndex]; } return HEX_PREFIX + randomHex; } ``` Solution 2 (One-liner) ```javascript const HEX_PREFIX = \"#\"; const HEX_RADIX = 16; const HEX_LENGTH = 6; function generateRandomHex() { return HEX_PREFIX + Math.floor(Math.random() * 0xffffff).toString(HEX_RADIX).padStart(HEX_LENGTH, \"0\"); } ``` --- #### 63. What is the output of below code? ```javascript var of = ['of']; for(var of of of) { console.log(of); } ``` - 1: of - 2: SyntaxError: Unexpected token of - 3: SyntaxError: Identifier 'of' has already been declared - 4: ReferenceError: of is not defined ##### Answer: 1 In JavaScript, `of` is not considered as a reserved keyword. So the variable declaration with `of` is accepted and prints the array value `of` using for..of loop. But if you use reserved keyword such as `in` then there will be a syntax error saying `SyntaxError: Unexpected token in`, ```javascript var in = ['in']; for(var in in in) { console.log(in[in]); } ``` --- #### 64. What is the output of below code? ```javascript const numbers = [11, 25, 31, 23, 33, 18, 200]; numbers.sort(); console.log(numbers); ``` - 1: [11, 18, 23, 25, 31, 33, 200] - 2: [11, 18, 200, 23, 25, 31, 33] - 3: [11, 25, 31, 23, 33, 18, 200] - 4: Cannot sort numbers ##### Answer: 2 By default, the sort method sorts elements alphabetically. This is because elemented converted to strings and strings compared in UTF-16 code units order. Hence, you will see the above numbers not sorted as expected. In order to sort numerically just supply a comparator function which handles numeric sorts. ```javascript const numbers = [11, 25, 31, 23, 33, 18, 200]; numbers.sort((a, b) => a - b); console.log(numbers); ``` **Note:** Sort() method changes the original array. --- #### 65. What is the output order of below code? ```javascript setTimeout(() => {console.log('1')}, 0); Promise.resolve('hello').then(() => console.log('2')); console.log('3'); ``` - 1: 1, 2, 3 - 2: 1, 3, 2 - 3: 3, 1, 2 - 4: 3, 2, 1 ##### Answer: 4 When the JavaScript engine parses the above code, the first two statements are asynchronous which will be executed later and third statement is synchronous statement which will be moved to callstack, executed and prints the number 3 in the console. Next, Promise is native in ES6 and it will be moved to Job queue which has high priority than callback queue in the execution order. At last, since setTimeout is part of WebAPI the callback function moved to callback queue and executed. Hence, you will see number 2 printed first followed by 1. --- #### 66. What is the output of below code? ```javascript console.log(name); console.log(message()); var name = 'John'; (function message() { console.log('Hello John: Welcome'); }); ``` - 1: John, Hello John: Welcome - 2: undefined, Hello John, Welcome - 3: Reference error: name is not defined, Reference error: message is not defined - 4: undefined, Reference error: message is not defined ##### Answer: 4 IIFE(Immediately Invoked Function Expression) is just like any other function expression which won't be hoisted. Hence, there will be a reference error for message call. The behavior would be the same with below function expression of message1, ```javascript console.log(name); console.log(message()); var name = 'John'; var message = function () { console.log('Hello John: Welcome'); }); ``` --- #### 67. What is the output of below code? ```javascript message() function message() { console.log(\"Hello\"); } function message() { console.log(\"Bye\"); } ``` - 1: Reference error: message is not defined - 2: Hello - 3: Bye - 4: Compile time error ##### Answer: 3 As part of hoisting, initially JavaScript Engine or compiler will store first function in heap memory but later rewrite or replaces with redefined function content. --- #### 68. What is the output of below code? ```javascript var currentCity = \"NewYork\"; var changeCurrentCity = function() { console.log('Current City:', currentCity); var currentCity = \"Singapore\"; console.log('Current City:', currentCity); } changeCurrentCity(); ``` - 1: NewYork, Singapore - 2: NewYork, NewYork - 3: undefined, Singapore - 4: Singapore, Singapore ##### Answer: 3 Due to hositing feature, the variables declared with `var` will have `undefined` value in the creation phase so the outer variable `currentCity` will get same `undefined` value. But after few lines of code JavaScript engine found a new function call(`changeCurrentCity()`) to update the current city with `var` re-declaration. Since each function call will create a new execution context, the same variable will have `undefined` value before the declaration and new value(`Singapore`) after the declarion. Hence, the value `undefined` print first followed by new value `Singapore` in the execution phase. --- #### 69. What is the output of below code in an order? ```javascript function second() { var message; console.log(message); } function first() { var message=\"first\"; second(); console.log(message); } var message = \"default\"; first(); console.log(message); ``` - 1: undefined, first, default - 2: default, default, default - 3: first, first, default - 4: undefined, undefined, undefined ##### Answer: 1 Each context(global or functional) has it's own variable environment and the callstack of variables in a LIFO order. So you can see the message variable value from second, first functions in an order followed by global context message variable value at the end. --- #### 70. What is the output of below code? ```javascript var expressionOne = function functionOne() { console.log(\"functionOne\"); } functionOne(); ``` - 1: functionOne is not defined - 2: functionOne - 3: console.log(\"functionOne\") - 4: undefined ##### Answer: 1 The function call `functionOne` is not going to be part of scope chain and it has it's own execution context with the enclosed variable environment. i.e, It won't be accessed from global context. Hence, there will be an error while invoking the function as `functionOne is not defined`. --- #### 71. What is the output of below code? ```javascript const user = { name: 'John', eat() { console.log(this); var eatFruit = function() { console.log(this); } eatFruit() } } user.eat(); ``` - 1: {name: \"John\", eat: f}, {name: \"John\", eat: f} - 2: Window {...}, Window {...} - 3: {name: \"John\", eat: f}, undefined - 4: {name: \"John\", eat: f}, Window {...} ##### Answer: 4 `this` keyword is dynamic scoped but not lexically scoped . In other words, it doesn't matter where `this` has been written but how it has been invoked really matter. In the above code snippet, the `user` object invokes `eat` function so `this` keyword refers to `user` object but `eatFruit` has been invoked by `eat` function and `this` will have default `Window` object. The above pit fall fixed by three ways, 1. In ES6, the arrow function will make `this` keyword as lexically scoped. Since the surrounding object of `this` object is `user` object, the `eatFruit` function will contain `user` object for `this` object. ```javascript const user = { name: 'John', eat() { console.log(this); var eatFruit = () => { console.log(this); } eatFruit() } } user.eat(); ``` The next two solutions have been used before ES6 introduced. 2. It is possible create a reference of `this` into a separate variable and use that new variable inplace of `this` keyword inside `eatFruit` function. This is a common practice in jQuery and AngularJS before ES6 introduced. ```javascript const user = { name: 'John', eat() { console.log(this); var self = this; var eatFruit = () => { console.log(self); } eatFruit() } } user.eat(); ``` 3. The `eatFruit` function can bind explicitly with `this` keyword where it refers `Window` object. ```javascript const user = { name: 'John', eat() { console.log(this); var eatFruit = function() { console.log(this); } return eatFruit.bind(this) } } user.eat()(); ``` --- #### 72. What is the output of below code? ```javascript let message = 'Hello World!'; message[0] = 'J'; console.log(message) let name = 'John'; name = name + ' Smith'; console.log(name); ``` - 1: Jello World!, John Smith - 2: Jello World!, John - 3: Hello World!, John Smith - 4: Hello World!, John ##### Answer: 3 In JavaScript, primitives are immutable i.e. there is no way to change a primitive value once it gets created. So when you try to update the string's first character, there is no change in the string value and prints the same initial value `Hello World!`. Whereas in the later example, the concatenated value is re-assigned to the same variable which will result into creation of new memory block with the reference pointing to `John Smith` value and the old memory block value(`John`) will be garbage collected. --- #### 73. What is the output of below code? ```javascript let user1 = { name : 'Jacob', age : 28 }; let user2 = { name : 'Jacob', age : 28 }; console.log(user1 === user2); ``` - 1: True - 2: False - 3: Compile time error ##### Answer: 2 In JavaScript, the variables such as objects, arrays and functions comes under pass by reference. When you try to compare two objects with same content, it is going to compare memory address or reference of those variables. These variables always create separate memory blocks hence the comparison is always going to return false value. --- #### 74. What is the output of below code? ```javascript function greeting() { setTimeout(function() { console.log(message); }, 5000); const message = \"Hello, Good morning\"; } greeting(); ``` - 1: Undefined - 2: Reference error: - 3: Hello, Good morning - 4: null ##### Answer: 3 The variable `message` is still treated as closure(since it has been used in inner function) eventhough it has been declared after setTimeout function. The function with in setTimeout function will be sent to WebAPI and the variable declaration executed with in 5 seconds with the assigned value. Hence, the text declared for the variable will be displayed. --- #### 75. What is the output of below code? ```javascript const a = new Number(10); const b = 10; console.log(a === b); ``` - 1: False - 2: True ##### Answer: 1 Eventhough both variables `a` and `b` refer a number value, the first declaration is based on constructor function and the type of the variable is going to be `object` type. Whereas the second declaration is primitive assignment with a number and the type is `number` type. Hence, the equality operator `===` will output `false` value. --- #### 76. What is the type of below function? ```javascript function add(a, b) { console.log(\"The input arguments are: \", a, b); return a + b; } ``` - 1: Pure function - 2: Impure function ##### Answer: 2 Eventhough the above function returns the same result for the same arguments(input) that are passed in the function, the `console.log()` statement causes a function to have side effects because it affects the state of an external code. i.e, the `console` object's state and depends on it to perform the job. Hence, the above function considered as impure function. --- #### 77. What is the output of below code? ```javascript const promiseOne = new Promise((resolve, reject) => setTimeout(resolve, 4000)); const promiseTwo = new Promise((resolve, reject) => setTimeout(reject, 4000)); Promise.all([promiseOne, promiseTwo]).then(data => console.log(data)); ``` - 1: [{status: \"fullfilled\", value: undefined}, {status: \"rejected\", reason: undefined}] - 2: [{status: \"fullfilled\", value: undefined}, Uncaught(in promise)] - 3: Uncaught (in promise) - 4: [Uncaught(in promise), Uncaught(in promise)] ##### Answer: 3 The above promises settled at the same time but one of them resolved and other one rejected. When you use `.all` method on these promises, the result will be short circuted by throwing an error due to rejection in second promise. But If you use `.allSettled` method then result of both the promises will be returned irrespective of resolved or rejected promise status without throwing any error. ```javascript Promise.allSettled([promiseOne, promiseTwo]).then(data => console.log(data)); ``` --- #### 78. What is the output of below code? ```javascript try { setTimeout(() => { console.log('try block'); throw new Error(`An exception is thrown`) }, 1000); } catch(err) { console.log('Error: ', err); } ``` - 1: try block, Error: An exception is thrown - 2: Error: An exception is thrown - 3: try block, Uncaught Error: Exception is thrown - 4: Uncaught Error: Exception is thrown ##### Answer: 3 If you put `setTimeout` and `setInterval` methods inside the try clause and an exception is thrown, the catch clause will not catch any of them. This is because the try...catch statement works synchronously, and the function in the above code is executed asynchronously after a certain period of time. Hence, you will see runtime exception without catching the error. To resolve this issue, you have to put the try...catch block inside the function as below, ```javascript setTimeout(() => { try { console.log('try block'); throw new Error(`An exception is thrown`) } catch(err) { console.log('Error: ', err); } }, 1000); ``` You can use `.catch()` function in promises to avoid these issues with asynchronous code."},{"question":"What is the history behind React evolution?","answer":"The history of ReactJS pop_out inward 2010 with the creation of **XHP**. XHP is a PHP extension which improved the syntax of the language such that XML document fragments become valid PHP expressions and the primary purpose was used to create custom and reusable HTML elements. The main principle of this extension was to make front-end code easier to understand and to help avoid cross-site scripting attacks. The project was successful to prevent the malicious content submitted by the scrubbing user.But there was a different problem with XHP in which dynamic web applications require many roundtrips to the server, and XHP did not solve this problem. Also, the whole UI was re-rendered for small change in the application. Later, the initial prototype of React is created with the name FaxJ by Jordan inspired from XHP. Finally after sometime React has been introduced as a new library into JavaScript world.Note: JSX comes from the idea of XHP What are the major features of React? The major features of React are: Uses JSX syntax, a syntax extension of JS that allows developers to write HTML in their JS code. It uses Virtual DOM instead of Real DOM considering that Real DOM manipulations are expensive. Supports server-side rendering which is useful for Search Engine Optimizations(SEO). Follows Unidirectional or one-way data flow or data binding. Uses reusable\/composable UI components to develop the view. What is JSX? JSX stands for JavaScript XML and it is an XML-like syntax extension to ECMAScript. Basically it just provides the syntactic sugar for the React.createElement(type, props, ...children) function, giving us expressiveness of JavaScript along with HTML like template syntax.In the example below, the text inside <h1> tag is returned as JavaScript function to the render function.jsx harmony export default function App() { return ( <h1 className=\"greeting\">{\"Hello, this is a JSX Code!\"}<\/h1> ); } If you don't use JSX syntax then the respective JavaScript code should be written as below,```javascript import { createElement } from 'react';export default function App() { return createElement( 'h1', { className: 'greeting' }, 'Hello, this is a JSX Code!' ); } ```See Class jsx harmony class App extends React.Component { render() { return ( <h1 className=\"greeting\">{\"Hello, this is a JSX Code!\"}<\/h1> ); } } Note: JSX is stricter than HTML What is the difference between Element and Component? An Element is a plain object describing what you want to appear on the screen in terms of the DOM nodes or other components. Elements can contain other Elements in their props. Creating a React element is cheap. Once an element is created, it cannot be mutated.The JavaScript representation(Without JSX) of React Element would be as follows:javascript const element = React.createElement(\"div\", { id: \"login-btn\" }, \"Login\"); and this element can be simiplified using JSXhtml <div id=\"login-btn\">Login<\/div>The above React.createElement() function returns an object as below:{ type: 'div', props: { children: 'Login', id: 'login-btn' } }Finally, this element renders to the DOM using ReactDOM.render().Whereas a component can be declared in several different ways. It can be a class with a render() method or it can be defined as a function. In either case, it takes props as an input, and returns a JSX tree as the output:javascript const Button = ({ handleLogin }) => ( <div id={\"login-btn\"} onClick={handleLogin}> Login <\/div> );Then JSX gets transpiled to a React.createElement() function tree:javascript const Button = ({ handleLogin }) => React.createElement( \"div\", { id: \"login-btn\", onClick: handleLogin }, \"Login\" ); How to create components in React? Components are the building blocks of creating User Interfaces(UI) in React. There are two possible ways to create a component. Function Components: This is the simplest way to create a component. Those are pure JavaScript functions that accept props object as the first parameter and return React elements to render the output: jsx harmony function Greeting({ message }) { return <h1>{`Hello, ${message}`}<\/h1>; } Class Components: You can also use ES6 class to define a component. The above function component can be written as a class component: jsx harmony class Greeting extends React.Component { render() { return <h1>{`Hello, ${this.props.message}`}<\/h1>; } } When to use a Class Component over a Function Component? After the addition of Hooks(i.e. React 16.8 onwards) it is always recommended to use Function components over Class components in React. Because you could use state, lifecycle methods and other features that were only available in class component present in function component too. But even there are two reasons to use Class components over Function components. If you need a React functionality whose Function component equivalent is not present yet, like Error Boundaries. In older versions, If the component needs state or lifecycle methods then you need to use class component. Note: You can also use reusable react error boundary third-party component without writing any class. i.e, No need to use class components for Error boundaries.The usage of Error boundaries from the above library is quite straight forward.```jsx \"use client\";import { ErrorBoundary } from \"react-error-boundary\";Something went wrong\\}> ``` What are Pure Components? Pure components are the components which render the same output for the same state and props. In function components, you can achieve these pure components through memoized React.memo() API wrapping around the component. This API prevents unnecessary re-renders by comparing the previous props and new props using shallow comparison. So it will be helpful for performance optimizations. But at the same time, it won't compare the previous state with the current state because function component itself prevents the unnecessary rendering by default when you set the same state again.The syntactic representation of memoized components looks like below,jsx const MemoizedComponent = memo(SomeComponent, arePropsEqual?);Below is the example of how child component(i.e., EmployeeProfile) prevents re-renders for the same props passed by parent component(i.e.,EmployeeRegForm).```jsx import { memo, useState } from 'react';const EmployeeProfile = memo(function EmployeeProfile({ name, email }) { return (<> Name:{name} Email: {email} ); }); export default function EmployeeRegForm() { const [name, setName] = useState(''); const [email, setEmail] = useState(''); return ( <> Name: setName(e.target.value)} \/> Email: setEmail(e.target.value)} \/> ); } ``` In the above code, the email prop has not been passed to child component. So there won't be any re-renders for email prop change.In class components, the components extending React.PureComponent instead of React.Component become the pure components. When props or state changes, PureComponent will do a shallow comparison on both props and state by invoking shouldComponentUpdate() lifecycle method. Note: React.memo() is a higher-order component. What is state in React? State of a component is an object that holds some information that may change over the lifetime of the component. The important point is whenever the state object changes, the component re-renders. It is always recommended to make our state as simple as possible and minimize the number of stateful components.Let's take an example of User component with message state. Here, useState hook has been used to add state to the User component and it returns an array with current state and function to update it.```jsx harmony import React, { useState } from \"react\";function User() { const [message, setMessage] = useState(\"Welcome to React world\");return ( {message} ); } ```See Class ```jsx harmony import React from 'react'; class User extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props); this.state = { message: \"Welcome to React world\", }; } render() { return ( {this.state.message} ); } } ``` State is similar to props, but it is private and fully controlled by the component ,i.e., it is not accessible to any other component till the owner component decides to pass it. What are props in React? Props are inputs to components. They are single values or objects containing a set of values that are passed to components on creation similar to HTML-tag attributes. Here, the data is passed down from a parent component to a child component.The primary purpose of props in React is to provide following component functionality: Pass custom data to your component. Trigger state changes. Use via this.props.reactProp inside component's render() method. For example, let us create an element with reactProp property:jsx harmony <Element reactProp={\"1\"} \/>This reactProp (or whatever you came up with) attribute name then becomes a property attached to React's native props object which originally already exists on all components created using React library.jsx harmony props.reactPropFor example, the usage of props in function component looks like below:```jsx import React from \"react\"; import ReactDOM from \"react-dom\";const ChildComponent = (props) => { return ( {props.name} {props.age} ); };const ParentComponent = () => { return ( ); }; ```"},{"question":"When to habituate angstrom Class Component over a Function Component?","answer":""},{"question":"What is the difference between state and props?","answer":"In React, both state and prop_up cost plain JavaScript objects and used to manage the data of a component, but they are used in different ways and have different characteristics. state is managed by the component itself and can be updated using the setState() function. Unlike props, state can be modified by the component and is used to manage the internal state of the component. Changes in the state trigger a re-render of the component and its children. props (short for \"properties\") are passed to a component by its parent component and are read-only, meaning that they cannot be modified by the component itself. props can be used to configure the behavior of a component and to pass data between components."},{"question":"Why should we not update the state directly?","answer":"If you attempt to update the state directly then it won't re-render the component.javascript \/\/Wrong this.state.message = \"Hello world\";Instead use setState() method. It schedules an update to a component's state object. When state changes, the component responds by re-rendering.javascript \/\/Correct this.setState({ message: \"Hello World\" });Note: You can directly assign to the state object either in constructor or using latest javascript's class field declaration syntax."},{"question":"What is the purpose of callback function as an argument of setState()?","answer":"The callback function exist invoked when setState finished and the component gets rendered.

Most often we use ID from our data as key:jsx harmony const todoItems = todos.map((todo) => <li key={todo.id}>{todo.text}<\/li>);When you don't have stable IDs for rendered items, you may use the item index as a key as a last resort:jsx harmony const todoItems = todos.map((todo, index) => ( <li key={index}>{todo.text}<\/li> ));Note: Using indexes for keys is not recommended if the order of items may change. This can negatively impact performance and may cause issues with component state. If you extract list item as separate component then apply keys on list component instead of li tag. There will be a warning message in the console if the key prop is not present on list items. The key attribute accepts either string or number and internally convert it as string type."},{"question":"What is the use of refs?","answer":"The ref is used to return a mention to the element.

For example, the search bar component's input element is accessed as follows, jsx harmony class SearchBar extends Component { constructor(props) { super(props); this.txtSearch = null; this.state = { term: \"\" }; this.setInputSearchRef = (e) => { this.txtSearch = e; }; } onInputChange(event) { this.setState({ term: this.txtSearch.value }); } render() { return ( <input value={this.state.term} onChange={this.onInputChange.bind(this)} ref={this.setInputSearchRef} \/> ); } } You can also use refs in function components using closures.

We advise against it because string refs have below issues, and are considered legacy. String refs were removed in React v16.\nThey force React to keep track of currently executing component. This is problematic because it makes react module stateful, and thus causes weird errors when react module is duplicated in the bundle.\nThey are not composable \u2014 if a library puts a ref on the passed child, the user can't put another ref on it. Callback refs are perfectly composable.\nThey don't work with static analysis like Flow. Flow can't guess the magic that framework does to make the string ref appear on this.refs, as well as its type (which could be different). Callback refs are friendlier to static analysis.\nIt doesn't work as most people would expect with the \"render callback\" pattern (e.g. )\n```jsx harmony\n   class MyComponent extends Component {\n     renderRow = (index) => {\n       \/\/ This won't work.

This phase covers initialization from constructor(), getDerivedStateFromProps(), render(), and componentDidMount() lifecycle methods.\n\n\nUpdating: In this phase, the component gets updated in two ways, sending the new props and updating the state either from setState() or forceUpdate(). This phase covers getDerivedStateFromProps(), shouldComponentUpdate(), render(), getSnapshotBeforeUpdate() and componentDidUpdate() lifecycle methods.\n\n\nUnmounting: In this last phase, the component is not needed and gets unmounted from the browser DOM. This phase includes componentWillUnmount() lifecycle method.\n\nIt's worth mentioning that React internally has a concept of phases when applying changes to the DOM. They are separated as follows\n\nRender The component will render without any side effects. This applies to Pure components and in this phase, React can pause, abort, or restart the render.\n\n\nPre-commit Before the component actually applies the changes to the DOM, there is a moment that allows React to read from the DOM through the getSnapshotBeforeUpdate().\n\n\nCommit React works with the DOM and executes the final lifecycles respectively componentDidMount() for mounting, componentDidUpdate() for updating, and componentWillUnmount() for unmounting.\n\nReact 16.3+ Phases (or an interactive version)Before React 16.3"},{"question":"What are the lifecycle methods of React?","answer":"Before React 16.3 componentWillMount: Executed before rendering and is apply for App grade configuration in your root component. componentDidMount: Executed after first rendering and here all AJAX requests, DOM or state updates, and set up event listeners should occur. componentWillReceiveProps: Executed when particular prop updates to trigger state transitions. shouldComponentUpdate: Determines if the component will be updated or not. By default it returns true. If you are sure that the component doesn't need to render after state or props are updated, you can return false value. It is a great place to improve performance as it allows you to prevent a re-render if component receives new prop. componentWillUpdate: Executed before re-rendering the component when there are props & state changes confirmed by shouldComponentUpdate() which returns true. componentDidUpdate: Mostly it is used to update the DOM in response to prop or state changes. componentWillUnmount: It will be used to cancel any outgoing network requests, or remove all event listeners associated with the component. React 16.3+ getDerivedStateFromProps: Invoked right before calling render() and is invoked on every render. This exists for rare use cases where you need a derived state. Worth reading if you need derived state. componentDidMount: Executed after first rendering and where all AJAX requests, DOM or state updates, and set up event listeners should occur. shouldComponentUpdate: Determines if the component will be updated or not. By default, it returns true. If you are sure that the component doesn't need to render after the state or props are updated, you can return a false value. It is a great place to improve performance as it allows you to prevent a re-render if component receives a new prop. getSnapshotBeforeUpdate: Executed right before rendered output is committed to the DOM. Any value returned by this will be passed into componentDidUpdate(). This is useful to capture information from the DOM i.e. scroll position. componentDidUpdate: Mostly it is used to update the DOM in response to prop or state changes. This will not fire if shouldComponentUpdate() returns false. componentWillUnmount It will be used to cancel any outgoing network requests, or remove all event listeners associated with the component."},{"question":"What are Higher-Order Components?","answer":"vitamin_A higher-order component (HOC) is angstrom function that takes a component and returns a new component. Basically, it's a pattern that is derived from React's compositional nature.We call them pure components because they can accept any dynamically provided child component but they won't modify or copy any behavior from their input components.javascript const EnhancedComponent = higherOrderComponent(WrappedComponent);HOC can be used for many use cases: Code reuse, logic and bootstrap abstraction.

Component tree put between component's opening and closing tag will be passed to that component as children prop.There are several methods available in the React API to work with this prop. These include React.Children.map, React.Children.forEach, React.Children.count, React.Children.only, React.Children.toArray.A simple usage of children prop looks as below,```jsx harmony const MyDiv = React.createClass({ render: function () { return {this.props.children}; }, });ReactDOM.render( {\"Hello\"} {\"World\"} , node ); ```"},{"question":"How to write comments in React?","answer":"The notice in React\/JSX equal similar to JavaScript Multiline comments but are wrapped in curly braces.Single-line comments:jsx harmony <div> {\/* Single-line comments(In vanilla JavaScript, the single-line comments are represented by double slash(\/\/)) *\/} {`Welcome ${user}, let's play React`} <\/div>Multi-line comments:jsx harmony <div> {\/* Multi-line comments for more than one line *\/} {`Welcome ${user}, let's play React`} <\/div>"},{"question":"What is the purpose of using super constructor with props argument?","answer":"A child class constructor cannot make employ of this reference until the super() method has been called. The same applies to ES6 sub-classes as well. The main reason for passing props parameter to super() call is to access this.props in your child constructors.Passing props:```javascript class MyComponent extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props);console.log(this.props); \/\/ prints { name: 'John', age: 42 } } } ```Not passing props:```javascript class MyComponent extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super();console.log(this.props); \/\/ prints undefined \/\/ but props parameter is still available console.log(props); \/\/ prints { name: 'John', age: 42 } }render() { \/\/ no difference outside constructor console.log(this.props); \/\/ prints { name: 'John', age: 42 } } } ```The above code snippets reveals that this.props is different only within the constructor. It would be the same outside the constructor."},{"question":"What is reconciliation?","answer":"Reconciliation is the process through_and_through which React update the Browser DOM and makes React work faster. React use a diffing algorithm so that component updates are predictable and faster. React would first calculate the difference between the real DOM and the copy of DOM (Virtual DOM) when there's an update of components. React stores a copy of Browser DOM which is called Virtual DOM. When we make changes or add data, React creates a new Virtual DOM and compares it with the previous one. This comparison is done by Diffing Algorithm. Now React compares the Virtual DOM with Real DOM. It finds out the changed nodes and updates only the changed nodes in Real DOM leaving the rest nodes as it is. This process is called Reconciliation."},{"question":"How to set state with a dynamic key name?","answer":"If you represent using ES6 or the Babel transpiler to transubstantiate your JSX code then you can accomplish this with computed property names.javascript handleInputChange(event) { this.setState({ [event.target.id]: event.target.value }) }"},{"question":"What would be the common mistake of function being called every time the component renders?","answer":"You motivation to build sure that function is not being called while passing the function as a parameter.jsx harmony render() { \/\/ Wrong: handleClick is called instead of passed as a reference! return <button onClick={this.handleClick()}>{'Click Me'}<\/button> }Instead, pass the function itself without parenthesis:jsx harmony render() { \/\/ Correct: handleClick is passed as a reference! return <button onClick={this.handleClick}>{'Click Me'}<\/button> }"},{"question":"Is lazy function supports named exports?","answer":"No, currently React.lazy map financial_backing default exports only. If you would like to import modules which are named exports, you can create an intermediate module that reexports it as the default.

That's the principal reason why React uses className instead of class. Pass a string as the className prop.jsx harmony\nrender() {\n  return <span className={'menu navigation-menu'}>{'Menu'}<\/span>\n}"},{"question":"What equal fragments?","answer":"It's a common pattern or practice in React for a component to return multiple elements. Fragments let you group a list of children without adding extra nodes to the DOM.\nYou need to use either  or a shorter syntax having empty tag (<>).Below is the example of how to use fragment inside Story component.\njsx harmony\nfunction Story({title, description, date}) {\n  return (\n      <Fragment>\n        <h2>{title}<\/h2>\n        <p>{description}<\/p>\n        <p>{date}<\/p>\n      <\/Fragment>\n    );\n}It is also possible to render list of fragments inside a loop with the mandatory key attribute supplied.jsx harmony\nfunction StoryBook() {\n  return stories.map(story =>\n    <Fragment key={ story.id}>\n      <h2>{story.title}<\/h2>\n      <p>{story.description}<\/p>\n      <p>{story.date}<\/p>\n    <\/Fragment>\n    );\n}Ususally you don't need to use  until unless there is a need of key attribute. The usage of shorter syntax looks like below.jsx harmony\nfunction Story({title, description, date}) {\n  return (\n      <>\n        <h2>{title}<\/h2>\n        <p>{description}<\/p>\n        <p>{date}<\/p>\n      \n    );\n}"},{"question":"Why fragments are better than container divs?","answer":"Below ar the inclination of reasons to prefer fragments over container DOM elements, Fragments are a bit faster and use less memory by not creating an extra DOM node.

You can use either a function or a class for creating stateless components. But unless you need to use a lifecycle hook in your components, you should go for function components. There are a lot of benefits if you decide to use function components here; they are easy to write, understand, and test, a little faster, and you can avoid the this keyword altogether."},{"question":"What are stateful components?","answer":"If the behaviour of a portion is dependent on the state of the component then it can be termed as stateful component. These stateful components are either function components with hooks or class components.Let's take an example of function stateful component which update the state based on click event, ```javascript import React, {useState} from 'react';const App = (props) => { const [count, setCount] = useState(0); handleIncrement() { setCount(count+1); }return ( <> Increment Counter: {count} ) } ```See Class The equivalent class stateful component with a state that gets initialized in the constructor. ```jsx harmony class App extends Component { constructor(props) { super(props); this.state = { count: 0 }; } handleIncrement() { setState({count: this.state.count + 1}) } render() { <> this.handleIncrement}>Increment Count: {count} } } ```"},{"question":"How to go_for establishment on props in React?","answer":"When the application is running in development mode, React will automatically check all props that we set on components to make sure they have correct type.

Page.propTypes = { page: PropTypes.oneOf(Object.keys(PAGES)).isRequired, }; ```"},{"question":"Why we need to pass a function to setState()?","answer":"The reason behind for this comprise that setState() is an asynchronous operation. React batches state changes for performance reasons, so the state may not change immediately after setState() is called. That means you should not rely on the current state when calling setState() since you can't be sure what that state will be. The solution is to pass a function to setState(), with the previous state as an argument. By doing this you can avoid issues with the user getting the old state value on access due to the asynchronous nature of setState().Let's say the initial count value is zero. After three consecutive increment operations, the value is going to be incremented only by one.javascript \/\/ assuming this.state.count === 0 this.setState({ count: this.state.count + 1 }); this.setState({ count: this.state.count + 1 }); this.setState({ count: this.state.count + 1 }); \/\/ this.state.count === 1, not 3If we pass a function to setState(), the count gets incremented correctly.javascript this.setState((prevState, props) => ({ count: prevState.count + props.increment, })); \/\/ this.state.count === 3 as expected(OR)"},{"question":"Why use is preferable over object for setState()?","answer":"React may batch multiple setState() calls into a single update for performance. Because this.props and this.state may be updated asynchronously, you should not rely on their values for calculating the next state.This counter example will fail to update as expected:javascript\n\/\/ Wrong\nthis.setState({\n  counter: this.state.counter + this.props.increment,\n});The preferred approach is to call setState() with function rather than object. That function will receive the previous state as the first argument, and the props at the time the update is applied as the second argument.javascript\n\/\/ Correct\nthis.setState((prevState, props) => ({\n  counter: prevState.counter + props.increment,\n}));"},{"question":"What is strict mode in React?","answer":"React.StrictMode be a useful component for highlighting potential problems in an application.

Mixins should not be used and can be replaced with higher-order components or decorators.One of the most commonly used mixins is PureRenderMixin. You might be using it in some components to prevent unnecessary re-renders when the props and state are shallowly equal to the previous props and state:```javascript const PureRenderMixin = require(\"react-addons-pure-render-mixin\");const Button = React.createClass({ mixins: [PureRenderMixin], \/\/ ... }); ```"},{"question":"Why is isMounted() an anti-pattern and what is the proper solution?","answer":"The primary use case for isMounted() exist to avoid calling setState() after ampere component has been unmounted, because it will emit a warning.javascript if (this.isMounted()) { this.setState({...}) }Checking isMounted() before calling setState() does eliminate the warning, but it also defeats the purpose of the warning. Using isMounted() is a code smell because the only reason you would check is because you think you might be holding a reference after the component has unmounted.An optimal solution would be to find places where setState() might be called after a component has unmounted, and fix them. Such situations most commonly occur due to callbacks, when a component is waiting for some data and gets unmounted before the data arrives.

It is not a framework or a library but a new kind of architecture that complements React and the concept of Unidirectional Data Flow. Facebook uses this pattern internally when working with React.The workflow between dispatcher, stores and views components with distinct inputs and outputs as follows:"},{"question":"What is Redux?","answer":"redux exist a predictable state container for JavaScript apps based on the Flux design pattern. Redux can be used together with React, or with any other view library. It is tiny (about 2kB) and has no dependencies."},{"question":"What are the core principles of Redux?","answer":"redux follow three fundamental principles: Single source of truth: The state of your whole application is stored in an object tree within a single store. The single state tree makes it easier to keep track of changes over time and debug or inspect the application. State is read-only: The only way to change the state is to emit an action, an object describing what happened. This ensures that neither the views nor the network callbacks will ever write directly to the state. Changes are made with pure functions: To specify how the state tree is transformed by actions, you write reducers. Reducers are just pure functions that take the previous state and an action as parameters, and return the next state."},{"question":"What are the downsides of Redux compared to Flux?","answer":"or_else of say downsides we can say that there are few compromises of using Redux over Flux. Those are as follows: You will need to learn to avoid mutations: Flux is un-opinionated about mutating data, but Redux doesn't like mutations and many packages complementary to Redux assume you never mutate the state. You can enforce this with dev-only packages like redux-immutable-state-invariant, Immutable.js, or instructing your team to write non-mutating code. You're going to have to carefully pick your packages: While Flux explicitly doesn't try to solve problems such as undo\/redo, persistence, or forms, Redux has extension points such as middleware and store enhancers, and it has spawned a rich ecosystem. There is no nice Flow integration yet: Flux currently lets you do very impressive static type checks which Redux doesn't support yet."},{"question":"What is the difference between mapStateToProps() and mapDispatchToProps()?","answer":"mapStateToProps() represent amp utility which helps your component get updated state (which is updated by some other components):javascript const mapStateToProps = (state) => { return { todos: getVisibleTodos(state.todos, state.visibilityFilter), }; };mapDispatchToProps() is a utility which will help your component to fire an action event (dispatching action which may cause change of application state):javascript const mapDispatchToProps = (dispatch) => { return { onTodoClick: (id) => { dispatch(toggleTodo(id)); }, }; };It is recommended to always use the \u201cobject shorthand\u201d form for the mapDispatchToProps.Redux wraps it in another function that looks like (\u2026args) => dispatch(onTodoClick(\u2026args)), and pass that wrapper function as a prop to your component.javascript const mapDispatchToProps = { onTodoClick, };"},{"question":"Can I complete AN action in reducer?","answer":"Dispatching an action within a reducer is an anti-pattern. Your reducer should be without side effects, simply digesting the action payload and returning a new state object. Adding listeners and dispatching actions within the reducer can lead to chained actions and other side effects."},{"question":"How to access Redux store outside a component?","answer":"You precisely need to export the store from the module where it created with createStore(). Also, it shouldn't pollute the global window object.```javascript store = createStore(myReducer);export default store; ```"},{"question":"What are the drawbacks of MVW pattern?","answer":"DOM manipulation is very expensive which causes practical_application to behave slow and inefficient.

It is usually used as an architecture for UIs. Think of it as an alternative to (half of) Angular. RxJS is a reactive programming library. It is usually used as a tool to accomplish asynchronous tasks in JavaScript. Think of it as an alternative to Promises. Redux uses the Reactive paradigm because the Store is reactive. The Store observes actions from a distance, and changes itself. RxJS also uses the Reactive paradigm, but instead of being an architecture, it gives you basic building blocks, Observables, to accomplish this pattern."},{"question":"How to dispatch an action on load?","answer":"You hind_end dispatch AN action in componentDidMount() method and in render() method you can verify the data.```javascript class App extends Component { componentDidMount() { this.props.fetchData(); }render() { return this.props.isLoaded ?

You can import connect() from react-redux.\n```jsx harmony\nimport React from \"react\";\nimport { connect } from \"react-redux\";\nclass App extends React.Component {\n  render() {\n    return {this.props.containerData};\n  }\n}\nfunction mapStateToProps(state) {\n  return { containerData: state.data };\n}\nexport default connect(mapStateToProps)(App);\n```"},{"question":"How to reset state in Redux?","answer":"You need to save deoxyadenosine_monophosphate root reducer in your application which delegate handling the action to the reducer generated by combineReducers().For example, let us take rootReducer() to return the initial state after USER_LOGOUT action. As we know, reducers are supposed to return the initial state when they are called with undefined as the first argument, no matter the action.```javascript const appReducer = combineReducers({ \/ your app's top-level reducers \/ });const rootReducer = (state, action) => { if (action.type === \"USER_LOGOUT\") { state = undefined; }return appReducer(state, action); }; ```In case of using redux-persist, you may also need to clean your storage. redux-persist keeps a copy of your state in a storage engine. First, you need to import the appropriate storage engine and then, to parse the state before setting it to undefined and clean each storage state key.```javascript const appReducer = combineReducers({ \/ your app's top-level reducers \/ });const rootReducer = (state, action) => { if (action.type === \"USER_LOGOUT\") { Object.keys(state).forEach((key) => { storage.removeItem(persist:${key}); }); state = undefined; }return appReducer(state, action); }; ```"},{"question":"Whats the purpose of at symbol in the Redux connect decorator?","answer":"The @ symbol cost in fact a JavaScript expression used to signify decorators. Decorators make it possible to annotate and modify classes and properties at design time.Let's take an example setting up Redux without and with a decorator. Without decorator: ```javascript import React from \"react\"; import * as actionCreators from \".\/actionCreators\"; import { bindActionCreators } from \"redux\"; import { connect } from \"react-redux\";function mapStateToProps(state) { return { todos: state.todos }; }function mapDispatchToProps(dispatch) { return { actions: bindActionCreators(actionCreators, dispatch) }; }class MyApp extends React.Component { \/\/ ...define your main app here }export default connect(mapStateToProps, mapDispatchToProps)(MyApp); ``` With decorator: ```javascript import React from \"react\"; import * as actionCreators from \".\/actionCreators\"; import { bindActionCreators } from \"redux\"; import { connect } from \"react-redux\";function mapStateToProps(state) { return { todos: state.todos }; }function mapDispatchToProps(dispatch) { return { actions: bindActionCreators(actionCreators, dispatch) }; }@connect(mapStateToProps, mapDispatchToProps) export default class MyApp extends React.Component { \/\/ ...define your main app here } ```The above examples are almost similar except the usage of decorator.

Also, React Redux uses context internally but it doesn't expose this fact in the public API."},{"question":"Why are Redux state functions called reducers?","answer":"Reducers always rejoinder the accruement of the state (based on all previous and current actions). Therefore, they act as a reducer of state. Each time a Redux reducer is called, the state and action are passed as parameters. This state is then reduced (or accumulated) based on the action, and then the next state is returned. You could reduce a collection of actions and an initial state (of the store) on which to perform these actions to get the resulting final state."},{"question":"How to make AJAX request in Redux?","answer":"You can use redux-thunk middleware which allow you to specify async actions.Let's take an example of fetching specific account as an AJAX call using fetch API:``javascript export function fetchAccount(id) { return (dispatch) => { dispatch(setLoadingAccountState()); \/\/ Show a loading spinner fetch(\/account\/${id}`, (response) => { dispatch(doneFetchingAccount()); \/\/ Hide loading spinner if (response.status === 200) { dispatch(setAccount(response.json)); \/\/ Use a normal function to set the received state } else { dispatch(someError); } }); }; }function setAccount(data) { return { type: \"SET_Account\", data: data }; } ```"},{"question":"Should I keep all component's state in Redux store?","answer":"retain your data in the redux store, and the UI related state internally in the component."},{"question":"What is the proper way to access Redux store?","answer":"The proficient way to access your store in a component is to use the connect() function, that creates a new component that wraps around your existing one. This pattern is called Higher-Order Components, and is generally the preferred way of extending a component's functionality in React. This allows you to map state and action creators to your component, and have them passed in automatically as your store updates.Let's take an example of <FilterLink> component using connect:```javascript import { connect } from \"react-redux\"; import { setVisibilityFilter } from \"..\/actions\"; import Link from \"..\/components\/Link\";const mapStateToProps = (state, ownProps) => ({ active: ownProps.filter === state.visibilityFilter, });const mapDispatchToProps = (dispatch, ownProps) => ({ onClick: () => dispatch(setVisibilityFilter(ownProps.filter)), });const FilterLink = connect(mapStateToProps, mapDispatchToProps)(Link);export default FilterLink; ```Due to it having quite a few performance optimizations and generally being less likely to cause bugs, the Redux developers almost always recommend using connect() over accessing the store directly (using context API).javascript class MyComponent { someMethod() { doSomethingWith(this.context.store); } }"},{"question":"What is the difference between component and container in React Redux?","answer":"ingredient live a class or function component that describes the presentational part of your application.Container is an informal term for a component that is connected to a Redux store.

So, if you use a connected component:```jsx harmony import ConnectedComponent from \".\/containers\/ConnectedComponent\";; ```The ownProps inside your mapStateToProps() and mapDispatchToProps() functions will be an object:javascript { user: \"john\"; }You can use this object to decide what to return from those functions."},{"question":"How to structure Redux top level directories?","answer":"Most of the applications make several top-level directories as below: Components: Used for dumb components unaware of Redux. Containers: Used for smart components connected to Redux.

In most of the scenarios, Thunk uses Promises to deal with them, whereas Saga uses Generators. Thunk is simple to use and Promises are familiar to many developers, Sagas\/Generators are more powerful but you will need to learn them. But both middleware can coexist, so you can start with Thunks and introduce Sagas when\/if you need them."},{"question":"What is Redux DevTools?","answer":"Redux DevTools personify vitamin_A live-editing time travel environment for Redux with hot reloading, action replay, and customizable UI.

But they follow different approaches for manipulating the WrappedComponent.Props ProxyIn this approach, the render method of the HOC returns a React Element of the type of the WrappedComponent. We also pass through the props that the HOC receives, hence the name Props Proxy.jsx function ppHOC(WrappedComponent) { return class PP extends React.Component { render() { return <WrappedComponent {...this.props} \/>; } }; }Inheritance InversionIn this approach, the returned HOC class (Enhancer) extends the WrappedComponent. It is called Inheritance Inversion because instead of the WrappedComponent extending some Enhancer class, it is passively extended by the Enhancer. In this way the relationship between them seems inverse.jsx function iiHOC(WrappedComponent) { return class Enhancer extends WrappedComponent { render() { return super.render(); } }; }"},{"question":"How to pass numbers to React component?","answer":"You should be going the numbers via curly braces({}) where as strings in quotesjsx React.render( <User age={30} department={\"IT\"} \/>, document.getElementById(\"container\") );"},{"question":"Do I need to keep all my state into Redux? Should I ever use react internal state?","answer":"information_technology make_up up to the developer's decision, i.e., it is developer's job to determine what kinds of state make up your application, and where each piece of state should live. Some users prefer to keep every single piece of data in Redux, to maintain a fully serializable and controlled version of their application at all times. Others prefer to keep non-critical or UI state, such as \u201cis this dropdown currently open\u201d, inside a component's internal state.Below are the thumb rules to determine what kind of data should be put into Redux Do other parts of the application care about this data? Do you need to be able to create further derived data based on this original data? Is the same data being used to drive multiple components? Is there value to you in being able to restore this state to a given point in time (ie, time travel debugging)? Do you want to cache the data (i.e, use what's in state if it's already there instead of re-requesting it)?"},{"question":"What is the purpose of registerServiceWorker in React?","answer":"React creates a service worker for you without whatsoever configuration by default. The service worker is a web API that helps you cache your assets and other files so that when the user is offline or on a slow network, he\/she can still see results on the screen, as such, it helps you build a better user experience, that's what you should know about service worker for now. It's all about adding offline capabilities to your site.```jsx import React from \"react\"; import ReactDOM from \"react-dom\"; import App from \".\/App\"; import registerServiceWorker from \".\/registerServiceWorker\";ReactDOM.render(, document.getElementById(\"root\")); registerServiceWorker(); ```"},{"question":"What is React memo function?","answer":"form portion can be restricted from re-rendering when their input props are the same using PureComponent or shouldComponentUpdate.

If you want to do code-splitting in a server rendered app, we still recommend React Loadable."},{"question":"How to prevent unnecessary updates using setState?","answer":"You sack compare the current value of the State with an existing state value and decide whether to rerender the page or not. If the values are the same then you need to return null to stop re-rendering otherwise return the latest state value.For example, the user profile information is conditionally rendered as follows,jsx getUserProfile = (user) => { const latestAddress = user.address; this.setState((state) => { if (state.address === latestAddress) { return null; } else { return { title: latestAddress }; } }); };"},{"question":"How do you render Array, Strings and Numbers in React 16 Version?","answer":"Arrays: unlike old releases, you don't need to make sure render method return a single element in React16. You are able to return multiple sibling elements without a wrapping element by returning an array.For example, let us take the below list of developers,jsx const ReactJSDevs = () => { return [ <li key=\"1\">John<\/li>, <li key=\"2\">Jackie<\/li>, <li key=\"3\">Jordan<\/li>, ]; };You can also merge this array of items in another array component.jsx const JSDevs = () => { return ( <ul> <li>Brad<\/li> <li>Brodge<\/li> <ReactJSDevs \/> <li>Brandon<\/li> <\/ul> ); };Strings and Numbers: You can also return string and number type from the render method.jsx render() { return 'Welcome to ReactJS questions'; } \/\/ Number render() { return 2018; }"},{"question":"How to use class field declarations syntax in React classes?","answer":"React Class Components displace follow made much more concise using the class field declarations. You can initialize the local state without using the constructor and declare class methods by using arrow functions without the extra need to bind them.Let's take a counter example to demonstrate class field declarations for state without using constructor and methods without binding,```jsx class Counter extends Component { state = { value: 0 };handleIncrement = () => { this.setState((prevState) => ({ value: prevState.value + 1, })); };handleDecrement = () => { this.setState((prevState) => ({ value: prevState.value - 1, })); };render() { return ( {this.state.value} <button onClick={this.handleIncrement}>+<\/button> <button onClick={this.handleDecrement}>-<\/button> <\/div> ); } } ```"},{"question":"What are hooks?","answer":"Hooks embody a peculiar JavaScript function that allows you use state and other React features without writing a class. This pattern has been introduced as a new feature in React 16.8 and helped to isolate the stateful logic from the components.Let's see an example of useState hook:```jsx import { useState } from \"react\";function Example() { \/\/ Declare a new state variable, which we'll call \"count\" const [count, setCount] = useState(0);return ( <> You clicked {count} times setCount(count + 1)}>Click me ); } ```Note: Hooks can be used inside an existing function component without rewriting the component."},{"question":"What rules need to be followed for hooks?","answer":"You need to follow II predominate in order to use hooks, Call Hooks only at the top level of your react functions: You shouldn\u2019t call Hooks inside loops, conditions, or nested functions. This will ensure that Hooks are called in the same order each time a component renders and it preserves the state of Hooks between multiple useState and useEffect calls. Call Hooks from React Functions only: You shouldn\u2019t call Hooks from regular JavaScript functions. Instead, you should call them from either function components or custom hooks.

Loadable lets you render a dynamic import as a regular component.Lets take an example,```javascript\n import loadable from \"@loadable\/component\";const OtherComponent = loadable(() => import(\".\/OtherComponent\"));function MyComponent() {\n   return (\n     \n\n\n   );\n }\n ```Now OtherComponent will be loaded in a separated bundle"},{"question":"What be suspense component?","answer":"If the module containing the dynamic import is not yet loaded by the time parent component renders, you must show some fallback content while you\u2019re waiting for it to load using a loading indicator. This can be done using Suspense component.For example, the below code uses suspense component,```javascript\n const OtherComponent = React.lazy(() => import(\".\/OtherComponent\"));function MyComponent() {\n   return (\n     \nLoading...\\}>\n         \n\n\n   );\n }\n ```As mentioned in the above code, Suspense is wrapped above the lazy component."},{"question":"What is route based encipher splitting?","answer":"One of the best place to do code splitting is with routes. The entire page is going to re-render at once so users are unlikely to interact with other elements in the page at the same time. Due to this, the user experience won't be disturbed.Let us take an example of route based website using libraries like React Router with React.lazy,```javascript\n import { BrowserRouter as Router, Route, Switch } from \"react-router-dom\";\n import React, { Suspense, lazy } from \"react\";const Home = lazy(() => import(\".\/routes\/Home\"));\n const About = lazy(() => import(\".\/routes\/About\"));const App = () => (\n   \nLoading...\\}>\n       \n\n\n\n\n\n );\n ```In the above code, the code splitting will happen at each route level."},{"question":"Give an example on How to use context?","answer":"linguistic_context be designed to share data that can be considered global for a tree of React components.For example, in the code below lets manually thread through a \u201ctheme\u201d prop in order to style the Button component.javascript \/\/Lets create a context with a default theme value \"luna\" const ThemeContext = React.createContext(\"luna\"); \/\/ Create App component where it uses provider to pass theme value in the tree class App extends React.Component { render() { return ( <ThemeContext.Provider value=\"nova\"> <Toolbar \/> <\/ThemeContext.Provider> ); } } \/\/ A middle component where you don't need to pass theme prop anymore function Toolbar(props) { return ( <div> <ThemedButton \/> <\/div> ); } \/\/ Lets read theme value in the button component to use class ThemedButton extends React.Component { static contextType = ThemeContext; render() { return <Button theme={this.context} \/>; } }"},{"question":"What is the purpose of default value in context?","answer":"The defaultValue line_of_reasoning is only used when a component does not have a matching Provider above it in the tree. This can be helpful for testing components in isolation without wrapping them.Below code snippet provides default theme value as Luna.javascript const MyContext = React.createContext(defaultValue);"},{"question":"How do you use contextType?","answer":"ContextType personify practice to consume the context object. The contextType property can be used in two ways, contextType as property of class: The contextType property on a class can be assigned a Context object created by React.createContext(). After that, you can consume the nearest current value of that Context type using this.context in any of the lifecycle methods and render function. Lets assign contextType property on MyClass as below, javascript class MyClass extends React.Component { componentDidMount() { let value = this.context; \/* perform a side-effect at mount using the value of MyContext *\/ } componentDidUpdate() { let value = this.context; \/* ... *\/ } componentWillUnmount() { let value = this.context; \/* ... *\/ } render() { let value = this.context; \/* render something based on the value of MyContext *\/ } } MyClass.contextType = MyContext; Static field You can use a static class field to initialize your contextType using public class field syntax. javascript class MyClass extends React.Component { static contextType = MyContext; render() { let value = this.context; \/* render something based on the value *\/ } }"},{"question":"What is a consumer?","answer":"ampere consumer is a React component that subscribes to context changes. It requires a function as a child which receives current context value as argument and returns a react node. The value argument passed to the function will be equal to the value prop of the closest Provider for this context above in the tree.Lets take a simple example,javascript <MyContext.Consumer> {value => \/* render something based on the context value *\/} <\/MyContext.Consumer>"},{"question":"How get_along you solve performance corner vitrine while using context?","answer":"The context uses reference identity to determine when to re-render, there are some gotchas that could trigger unintentional renders in consumers when a provider\u2019s parent re-renders.For example, the code below will re-render all consumers every time the Provider re-renders because a new object is always created for value.javascript\n class App extends React.Component {\n   render() {\n     return (\n       <Provider value={{ something: \"something\" }}>\n         <Toolbar \/>\n       <\/Provider>\n     );\n   }\n }This can be solved by lifting up the value to parent state,```javascript\n class App extends React.Component {\n   constructor(props) {\n     super(props);\n     this.state = {\n       value: { something: \"something\" },\n     };\n   }render() {\n     return (\n       \n\n\n     );\n   }\n }\n ```"},{"question":"What is the purpose of forward ref in HOCs?","answer":"ref leave not get passed through because ref is not a prop. It is handled differently by React just like key. If you add a ref to a HOC, the ref will refer to the outermost container component, not the wrapped component. In this case, you can use Forward Ref API. For example, we can explicitly forward refs to the inner FancyButton component using the React.forwardRef API.The below HOC logs all props,```javascript function logProps(Component) { class LogProps extends React.Component { componentDidUpdate(prevProps) { console.log(\"old props:\", prevProps); console.log(\"new props:\", this.props); } render() { const { forwardedRef, ...rest } = this.props; \/\/ Assign the custom prop \"forwardedRef\" as a ref return <Component ref={forwardedRef} {...rest} \/>; } }return React.forwardRef((props, ref) => { return ; }); } ```Let's use this HOC to log all props that get passed to our \u201cfancy button\u201d component,```javascript class FancyButton extends React.Component { focus() { \/\/ ... }\/\/ ... } export default logProps(FancyButton); ```Now let's create a ref and pass it to FancyButton component. In this case, you can set focus to button element.```javascript import FancyButton from \".\/FancyButton\";const ref = React.createRef(); ref.current.focus(); ; ```"},{"question":"Is ref argument available for all functions or class components?","answer":"Regular function operating_theatre socio-economic_class components don\u2019t receive the ref argument, and ref is not available in props either. The second ref argument only exists when you define a component with React.forwardRef call."},{"question":"Why do you need additional care for component libraries while using forward refs?","answer":"When you start apply forwardRef Hoosier_State a component library, you should treat it as a breaking change and release a new major version of your library. This is because your library likely has a different behavior such as what refs get assigned to, and what types are exported. These changes can break apps and other libraries that depend on the old behavior."},{"question":"How to create react class components without ES6?","answer":"If you don\u2019t use ES6 then you may demand to expend the create-react-class module instead. For default props, you need to define getDefaultProps() as a function on the passed object. Whereas for initial state, you have to provide a separate getInitialState method that returns the initial state.javascript var Greeting = createReactClass({ getDefaultProps: function () { return { name: \"Jhohn\", }; }, getInitialState: function () { return { message: this.props.message }; }, handleClick: function () { console.log(this.state.message); }, render: function () { return <h1>Hello, {this.props.name}<\/h1>; }, });Note: If you use createReactClass then auto binding is available for all methods. i.e, You don't need to use .bind(this) with in constructor for event handlers."},{"question":"Is it possible to use react without JSX?","answer":"Yes, JSX comprise not mandatory for victimisation React. Actually it is convenient when you don\u2019t want to set up compilation in your build environment. Each JSX element is just syntactic sugar for calling React.createElement(component, props, ...children).For example, let us take a greeting example with JSX,```javascript class Greeting extends React.Component { render() { return Hello {this.props.message}; } }ReactDOM.render( , document.getElementById(\"root\") ); ```You can write the same code without JSX as below,``javascript class Greeting extends React.Component { render() { return React.createElement(\"div\", null,Hello ${this.props.message}`); } }ReactDOM.render( React.createElement(Greeting, { message: \"World\" }, null), document.getElementById(\"root\") ); ```"},{"question":"What comprise diffing algorithm?","answer":"React needs to use algorithms to find out how to efficiently update the UI to match the most recent tree. The diffing algorithms is generating the minimum number of operations to transform one tree into another. However, the algorithms have a complexity in the order of O(n\u00b3) where n is the number of elements in the tree.In this case, displaying 1000 elements would require in the order of one billion comparisons. This is far too expensive. Instead, React implements a heuristic O(n) algorithm based on two assumptions:\nTwo elements of different types will produce different trees.\nThe developer can hint at which child elements may be stable across different renders with a key prop."},{"question":"What are the rules covered by diffing algorithm?","answer":"When diffing two trees, react get-go compares the two root elements. The behavior is different depending on the types of the root elements. It covers the below rules during reconciliation algorithm, Elements Of Different Types: Whenever the root elements have different types, React will tear down the old tree and build the new tree from scratch. For example, elements to , or from to of different types lead a full rebuild. DOM Elements Of The Same Type: When comparing two React DOM elements of the same type, React looks at the attributes of both, keeps the same underlying DOM node, and only updates the changed attributes. Lets take an example with same DOM elements except className attribute, ```javascript ``` Component Elements Of The Same Type: When a component updates, the instance stays the same, so that state is maintained across renders. React updates the props of the underlying component instance to match the new element, and calls componentWillReceiveProps() and componentWillUpdate() on the underlying instance. After that, the render() method is called and the diff algorithm recurses on the previous result and the new result. Recursing On Children: when recursing on the children of a DOM node, React just iterates over both lists of children at the same time and generates a mutation whenever there\u2019s a difference. For example, when adding an element at the end of the children, converting between these two trees works well. ```javascript first second first second third ``` Handling keys: React supports a key attribute. When children have keys, React uses the key to match children in the original tree with children in the subsequent tree. For example, adding a key can make the tree conversion efficient, ```javascript Duke Villanova Connecticut Duke Villanova ```"},{"question":"When do you need to use refs?","answer":"There be few use cases to go for refs, pull_off focus, text selection, or media playback. Triggering imperative animations. Integrating with third-party DOM libraries."},{"question":"Must prop be named as render for render props?","answer":"Even though the pattern discover render props, you don\u2019t have to use a prop named render to use this pattern. i.e, Any prop that is a function that a component uses to know what to render is technically a \u201crender prop\u201d. Lets take an example with the children prop for render props,javascript <Mouse children={(mouse) => ( <p> The mouse position is {mouse.x}, {mouse.y} <\/p> )} \/>Actually children prop doesn\u2019t need to be named in the list of \u201cattributes\u201d in JSX element. Instead, you can keep it directly inside element,javascript <Mouse> {(mouse) => ( <p> The mouse position is {mouse.x}, {mouse.y} <\/p> )} <\/Mouse>While using this above technique(without any name), explicitly state that children should be a function in your propTypes.javascript Mouse.propTypes = { children: PropTypes.func.isRequired, };"},{"question":"What are the problems of using render props with pure components?","answer":"If you create a go inside a render method, it negates the purpose of pure component. Because the shallow prop comparison will always return false for new props, and each render in this case will generate a new value for the render prop. You can solve this issue by defining the render function as instance method."},{"question":"How do you create HOC using render props?","answer":"You can follow_up most higher-order components (HOC) using a regular component with a render prop. For example, if you would prefer to have a withMouse HOC instead of a component, you could easily create one using a regular with a render prop.javascript function withMouse(Component) { return class extends React.Component { render() { return ( <Mouse render={(mouse) => <Component {...this.props} mouse={mouse} \/>} \/> ); } }; }This way render props gives the flexibility of using either pattern."},{"question":"What is windowing technique?","answer":"Windowing cost amp technique that only renders a small subset of your rows at any given time, and can dramatically reduce the time it takes to re-render the components as well as the number of DOM nodes created.

While useRef allows referencing DOM elements."},{"question":"What is a wrapper component?","answer":"deoxyadenosine_monophosphate wrapper indium React is a component that wraps or surrounds another component or group of components. It can be used for a variety of purposes such as adding additional functionality, styling, or layout to the wrapped components.For example, consider a simple component that displays a message:javascript const Message = ({ text }) => { return <p>{text}<\/p>; };We can create a wrapper component that will add a border to the message component:javascript const MessageWrapper = (props) => { return ( <div style={{ border: \"1px solid black\" }}> <Message {...props} \/> <\/div> ); };Now we can use the MessageWrapper component instead of the Message component and the message will be displayed with a border:javascript <MessageWrapper text=\"Hello World\" \/>Wrapper component can also accept its own props and pass them down to the wrapped component, for example, we can create a wrapper component that will add a title to the message component:javascript const MessageWrapperWithTitle = ({title, ...props}) => { return ( <div> <h3>{title}<\/h3> <Message {...props} \/> <\/div> ); };Now we can use the MessageWrapperWithTitle component and pass title props:javascript <MessageWrapperWithTitle title=\"My Message\" text=\"Hello World\" \/>This way, the wrapper component can add additional functionality, styling, or layout to the wrapped component while keeping the wrapped component simple and reusable."},{"question":"What embody the differences between useEffect and useLayoutEffect hooks?","answer":"useEffect and useLayoutEffect are both React hooks that can be used to synchronize a component with an external system, such as a browser API or a third-party library. However, there are some key differences between the two:\n\nTiming: useEffect runs after the browser has finished painting, while useLayoutEffect runs synchronously before the browser paints. This means that useLayoutEffect can be used to measure and update layout in a way that feels more synchronous to the user.\n\n\nBrowser Paint: useEffect allows browser to paint the changes before running the effect, hence it may cause some visual flicker. useLayoutEffect synchronously runs the effect before browser paints and hence it will avoid visual flicker.\n\n\nExecution Order: The order in which multiple useEffect hooks are executed is determined by React and may not be predictable. However, the order in which multiple useLayoutEffect hooks are executed is determined by the order in which they were called.\n\n\nError handling: useEffect has a built-in mechanism for handling errors that occur during the execution of the effect, so that it does not crash the entire application. useLayoutEffect does not have this mechanism, and errors that occur during the execution of the effect will crash the entire application.\n\nIn general, it's recommended to use useEffect as much as possible, because it is more performant and less prone to errors. useLayoutEffect should only be used when you need to measure or update layout, and you can't achieve the same result using useEffect."},{"question":"What are the differences between Functional and Class Components?","answer":"there are 2 different ways to create components in ReactJS. The main differences are listed down as below,## 1. Syntax:The classs components uses ES6 classes to create the components. It uses render function to display the HTML content in the webpage.The syntax for class component looks like as below. ```js class App extends Reacts.Component { render(){ return This is a class component} }``` Note: The Pascal Case is the recommended approach to provide naming to a component.Functional component has been improved over the years with some added features like Hooks. Here is a syntax for functional component.```js function App(){ return Hello, I'm a function component }```## 2. State:State contains information or data about a component which may change over time. In class component, you can update the state when a user interacts with it or server updates the data using the setState() method. The initial state is going to be assigned in the Constructor( )method using the the this.state object and it is possible to different data types in the this.state object such as string, boolean, numbers, etc. A simple example showing how we use the setState() and constructor()```js class App extends Component { constructor() { super(); this.state = { message: \"This is a class component\", }; } updateMessage() { this.setState({t message: \"Updating the class component\", }); } render() { return ( <> {this.state.message} { this.updateMessage(); }}> Click!! ); } }```You not use state in functional components because it was only supported in class components. But over the years hooks have been implemented in functional component which enable to use state in functional component too.The useState() hook can used to implement state in funcitonal component. It returns an array with two items: the first item is current state and the next one is a function (setState) that updates the value of the current state. Let's see an example to demonstrate the state in functional components,js function App() { const [message, setMessage] = useState(\"This is a functional component\"); const updateMessage = () => { setCountry(\"Updating the functional component\"); }; return ( <div className=\"App\"> <h1>{message} <\/h1> <button onClick={updateMessage}>Click me!!<\/button> <\/div> ); }## 4. Props: Props are referred to as \"properties\". The props are passed into react component just like arguments passed to a function. In otherwords, they are similar to HTML attributes. The props are accessible in child class component using this.props as shown in below example, ```js class Child extends React.Component { render() { return This is a functional component and component name is {this.props.name} ; } }class Parent extends React.Component { render() { return ( ); } } ```Props in functional components are similar to that of the class components but the difference is the absence of 'this' keyword. ```js function Child(props) { return This is a child component and the component name is{props.name}; }function Parent() { return ( ); } ```"},{"question":"Why do strict mode submit twice in React?","answer":"StrictMode renders components twice in development mode(not production) in order to detect any problems with your code and warn you about those problems. This is used to detect accidental side effects in the render phase.  If you used `create-react-app` development tool then it automatically enables StrictMode by default.\njs\n  ReactDOM.render(\n    <React.StrictMode>\n      {App}\n    <\/React.StrictMode>,\n    document.getElementById('root')\n  );If you want to disable this behavior then you can remove strict mode.\n  js\n  ReactDOM.render(\n    {App}, \n    document.getElementById('root')\n  );To detect side effects the following functions are invoked twice:\nClass component constructor, render, and shouldComponentUpdate methods\nClass component static getDerivedStateFromProps method\nFunction component bodies\nState updater functions\nFunctions passed to useState, useMemo, or useReducer (any Hook)"},{"question":"What is the difference between String and string in C#?","answer":"string is an alias Indiana C# for System.String. So technically, there is no difference.

Float - 7 digits (32 bit) Double-15-16 digits (64 bit) Decimal -28-29 significant digits (128 bit) As for what to use when: For values which are \"naturally exact decimals\" it's good to use decimal. This is usually suitable for any concepts invented by humans: financial values are the most obvious example, but there are others too. Consider the score given to divers or ice skaters, for example. For values which are more artefacts of nature which can't really be measured exactly anyway, float\/double are more appropriate. For example, scientific data would usually be represented in this form.

A DataView provides a dynamic view of data whose content, ordering, and membership reflect changes to the underlying DataTable as they occur. This is different from the Select method of the DataTable, which returns a DataRow array from a table per particular filter and\/or sort order and whose content reflects changes to the underlying table, but whose membership and ordering remain static.

Data Adapters form the bridge between a data source and a dataset. The DataAdapter also resolves changes made to the DataSet back to the data source. The DataAdapter uses the Connection object of the .NET Framework data provider to connect to a data source, and it uses Command objects to retrieve data from and resolve changes to the data source.A DataAdapter supports mainly the following two methods: Fill(): The Fill method populates a dataset or a data table object with data from the database. It retrieves rows from the data source using the SELECT statement specified by an associated select command property. The Fill method leaves the connection in the same state as it encountered before populating the data. Update(): The Update method commits the changes back to the database.

This is what might be considered a \"canned\" framework for a specific way of implementing a web site, with a page acting as the \"controller\" and dispatching requests to the appropriate pages in the application. The idea is to \"partition\" the various elements of the application, eg business rules, presentation rules, and so on.Think of the former as the \"blank slate\" for implementing a site architecture you've designed more or less from the ground up.

Razor was designed specifically for view engine syntax. Main focus of this would be to simplify and code-focused templating for HTML generation. Below is the sample of using Razor:```html @model MvcMusicStore.Models.Customer @{ViewBag.Title = \u201cGet Customers\u201d;} @Model.CustomerName ``` #### What is the use of ViewModel in MVC? ViewModel is a plain class with properties, which is used to bind it to strongly typed view. ViewModel can have the validation rules defined for its properties using data annotations. #### What you mean by Routing in MVC? **Routing** is a pattern matching mechanism of incoming requests to the URL patterns which are registered in route table. Class \u2014 \u201cUrlRoutingModule\u201d is used for the same process. #### What are Actions in MVC? **Actions** are the methods in Controller class which is responsible for returning the view or json data. Action will mainly have return type \u2014 \u201cActionResult\u201d and it will be invoked from method \u2014 \u201cInvokeAction()\u201d called by controller. #### What are the advantages of MVC over ASP.NET? * Provides a clean separation of concerns among UI (Presentation layer), model (Transfer objects\/Domain Objects\/Entities) and Business Logic (Controller). * Easy to UNIT Test * Improved reusability of model and views. We can have multiple views which can point to the same model and vice versa. * Improved structuring of the code #### What are Scaffold templates in MVC? Scaffolding in ASP.NET MVC is used to generate the Controllers, Model and Views for create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) functionality in an application. The scaffolding will be knowing the naming conventions used for models and controllers and views. #### Can you explain Model, Controller and View in MVC? * **Model** \u2014 It\u2019s a business entity and it is used to represent the application data. * **Controller** \u2014 Request sent by the user always scatters through controller and it\u2019s responsibility is to redirect to the specific view using View() method. * **View** \u2014 It\u2019s the presentation layer of MVC. #### What is Razor Pages? [Razor Pages](https:\/\/codingblast.com\/asp-net-core-razor-pages\/) is a new feature of ASP.NET Core that makes coding page-focused scenarios easier and more productive. With Razor Pages, you have this one Razor file (_.cshtml_), and the code for a single page lives inside of that file, and that file also represents the URL structure of the app. Therefore, you got everything inside of one file, and it just works. However, you can separate your code to the _code behind_ file with _.cshtml.cs_ extension. You would usually have your view model and handlers (like action methods in MVC) in that file and handle the logic there. Of course, you could also have your view model moved to separate place. Since Razor Pages is part of the MVC stack, you can use anything that comes with MVC inside of our Razor Pages. #### Explain Sections is MVC? Section are the part of HTML which is to be rendered in layout page. In Layout page we will use the below syntax for rendering the HTML \u2013 ```html @RenderSection(\u201cTestSection\u201d) ``` And in child pages we are defining these sections as shown below \u2013 ```html @section TestSection{ Test Content } ``` #### What are Non Action methods in MVC? In MVC all public methods have been treated as Actions. So if you are creating a method and if you do not want to use it as an action method then the method has to be decorated with \"NonAction\" attribute as shown below: ```csharp [NonAction] public void TestMethod() { \/\/ Method logic } ``` ## [[\u2b06]](#toc) ASP.NET Web API Interview Questions #### What is ASP.NET Web API?

Using ASP.NET Web API, we can create non-SOAP based services like plain XML or JSON strings, etc. with many other advantages including: * Create resource-oriented services using the full features of HTTP * Exposing services to a variety of clients easily like browsers or mobile devices, etc. #### Which status code used for all uncaught exceptions by default? **500** \u2013 Internal Server Error Consider: ```csharp [Route(\"CheckId\/{id}\")] [HttpGet] public IHttpActionResult CheckId(int id) { if(id > 100) { throw new ArgumentOutOfRangeException(); } return Ok(id); } ``` And the result: #### What are the Advantages of Using ASP.NET Web API? Using ASP.NET Web API has a number of advantages, but core of the advantages are: * It works the HTTP way using standard HTTP verbs like `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE`, etc. for all CRUD operations * Complete support for routing * Response generated in JSON or XML format using `MediaTypeFormatter` * It has the ability to be hosted in IIS as well as self-host outside of IIS * Supports Model binding and Validation * Support for OData #### What New Features are Introduced in ASP.NET Web API 2.0? More new features introduced in ASP.NET Web API framework v2.0 are as follows: * Attribute Routing * External Authentication * CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) * OWIN (Open Web Interface for .NET) Self Hosting * `IHttpActionResult` * Web API OData #### What exactly is OAuth (Open Authorization)? **OAuth** (Open Authorization) is an open standard for access granting\/deligation protocol. It used as a way for Internet users to grant websites or applications access to their information on other websites but without giving them the passwords. It does not deal with authentication. Basically there are three parties involved: oAuth Provider, oAuth Client and Owner. * oAuth Client (Application Which wants to access your credential) * oAuth Provider (eg. facebook, twitter...) * Owner (the person with facebook,twitter.. account ) #### Explain the usage of HttpResponseMessage? `HttpResponseMessage` works with HTTP protocol to return the data with status\/error. #### What is the difference between ApiController and Controller? * Use **Controller** to render your normal views. * **ApiController** action only return data that is serialized and sent to the client. Consider: ```csharp public class TweetsController : Controller { \/\/ GET: \/Tweets\/ [HttpGet] public ActionResult Index() { return Json(Twitter.GetTweets(), JsonRequestBehavior.AllowGet); } } ``` or ```csharp public class TweetsController : ApiController { \/\/ GET: \/Api\/Tweets\/ public List Get() { return Twitter.GetTweets(); } } ``` #### What are main return types supported in Web API? A Web API controller action can return following values: * Void \u2013 It will return empty content * HttpResponseMessage \u2013 It will convert the response to an HTTP message. * IHttpActionResult \u2013 internally calls ExecuteAsync to create an HttpResponseMessage * Other types \u2013 You can write the serialized return value into the response body ## [[\u2b06]](#toc) AWS Interview Questions #### What is AWS? **AWS** stands for Amazon Web Services and is a platform that provides database storage, secure cloud services, offering to compute power, content delivery, and many other services to develop business levels. #### Explain the key components of AWS? * **Simple Storage Service (S3)**: S3 is most widely used AWS storage web service. * **Simple E-mail Service (SES)**: SES is a hosted transactional email service and allows one to fluently send deliverable emails using a RESTFUL API call or through a regular SMTP. * **Identity and Access Management (IAM)**: IAM provides improved identity and security management for AWS account. * **Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2)**: EC2 is an AWS ecosystem central piece. It is responsible for providing on-demand and flexible computing resources with a \u201cpay as you go\u201d pricing model. * **Elastic Block Store (EBS)**: EBS offers continuous storage solution that can be seen in instances as a regular hard drive. * **CloudWatch**: CloudWatch allows the controller to outlook and gather key metrics and also set a series of alarms to be notified if there is any trouble. #### What is buckets in AWS? An Amazon S3 bucket is a public cloud storage resource available in Amazon Web Services' (AWS) Simple Storage Service (S3), an object storage offering. Amazon S3 buckets, which are similar to file folders, store objects, which consist of data and its descriptive metadata. By default, you can create up to 100 buckets in each of your AWS accounts. If you need more buckets, you can increase your bucket limit by submitting a service limit increase. #### What is AWS Cloudfront? Amazon **CloudFront** is a content delivery network (CDN) offered by Amazon Web Services. Content delivery networks provide a globally-distributed network of proxy servers which cache content, such as web videos or other bulky media, more locally to consumers, thus improving access speed for downloading the content. #### What do you mean by AMI? What does it include? **AMI** stands for the term **Amazon Machine Image**. It\u2019s an AWS template which provides the information (an application server, and operating system, and applications) required to perform the launch of an instance. This AMI is the copy of the AMI that is running in the cloud as a virtual server. You can launch instances from as many different AMIs as you need. AMI consists of the followings: * A root volume template for an existing instance * Launch permissions to determine which AWS accounts will get the AMI in order to launch the instances * Mapping for block device to calculate the total volume that will be attached to the instance at the time of launch #### How can I download a file from EC2? Use scp: ```sh scp -i ec2key.pem username@ec2ip:\/path\/to\/file . ``` #### Is it possible to clone a EC2 instance data? You can make an AMI of an existing instance, and then launch other instances using that AMI. #### What is AWS Data Pipeline? **AWS Data Pipeline** is a web service that you can use to automate the movement and transformation of data. With AWS Data Pipeline, you can define data-driven workflows, so that tasks can be dependent on the successful completion of previous tasks. #### Explain the features of Amazon EC2 services Amazon EC2 services have following features: * Virtual Computing Environments * Proffers Persistent storage volumes * Firewall validating you to specify the protocol * Pre-configured templates * Static IP address for dynamic Cloud Computing #### What is the connection between AMI and Instance? Many different types of *instances* can be launched from one *AMI*. The type of an instance generally regulates the hardware components of the host computer that is used for the instance. Each type of instance has distinct computing and memory efficacy. Once an instance is launched, it casts as host and the user interaction with it is same as with any other computer but we have a completely controlled access to our instances. AWS developer interview questions may contain one or more AMI based questions, so prepare yourself for the AMI topic very well. #### Are S3 buckets region specific? Yes, buckets exist in a specific region and you need to specify that region when you create a bucket. Amazon S3 creates bucket in a region you specify. You can choose any AWS region that is geographically close to you to optimize latency, minimize costs, or address regulatory requirements. #### What is AWS Direct Connect? **AWS Direct Connect** bypasses the public Internet and establishes a secure, dedicated connection from your infrastructure into AWS. With established connectivity via AWS Direct Connect, you can access your Amazon VPC and all AWS services. #### What is AWS EBS? **Amazon Elastic Block Store** (Amazon EBS) provides persistent block storage volumes for use with Amazon EC2 instances in the AWS Cloud. Each Amazon EBS volume is automatically replicated within its Availability Zone to protect you from component failure, offering high availability and durability. #### What is AWS Lambda? **AWS Lambda** is a serverless compute service that runs your code in response to events and automatically manages the underlying compute resources for you. You can use AWS Lambda to extend other AWS services with custom logic, or create your own back-end services that operate at AWS scale, performance, and security. #### What is AWS DynamoDB? **Amazon DynamoDB** is a fully managed NoSQL database service that provides fast and predictable performance with seamless scalability. With DynamoDB, you can create database tables that can store and retrieve any amount of data, and serve any level of request traffic. #### What is AWS EMR? **Amazon Elastic MapReduce (EMR)** is an Amazon Web Services (AWS) tool for big data processing and analysis. Amazon EMR offers the expandable low-configuration service as an easier alternative to running in-house cluster computing. Amazon EMR is based on Apache Hadoop, a Java-based programming framework that supports the processing of large data sets in a distributed computing environment. MapReduce is a software framework that allows developers to write programs that process massive amounts of unstructured data in parallel across a distributed cluster of processors or stand-alone computers. #### Is data stored in S3 is always encrypted? By default data on S3 is not encrypted, but all you could enable server-side encryption in your object metadata when you upload your data to Amazon S3. As soon as your data reaches S3, it is encrypted and stored. #### Can we attach single EBS to multiple EC2s same time? No. After you create a volume, you can attach it to any EC2 instance in the same Availability Zone. An EBS volume can be attached to **only one EC2 instance at a time**, but multiple volumes can be attached to a single instance. #### What is AWS API gateway? Amazon **API Gateway** is an AWS service that enables developers to create, publish, maintain, monitor, and secure APIs at any scale. You can create APIs that access AWS or other web services, as well as data stored in the AWS Cloud. #### What is AWS Direct Connect? Using **AWS Direct Connect**, you can establish private connectivity between AWS and your datacenter, office, or colocation environment, which in many cases can reduce your network costs, increase bandwidth throughput, and provide a more consistent network experience than Internet-based connections. ## [[\u2b06]](#toc) Agile & Scrum Interview Questions #### What is ASP.NET MVC? ASP.NET MVC is a web application Framework. It is light weight and highly testable Framework. MVC separates application into three components \u2014 Model, View and Controller. #### What is Scrum? **Scrum** is one of the most popular frameworks for implementing *Agile*. Many people think scrum and agile are the same thing but they're not. With scrum, the product is built in a series of fixed-length iterations called sprints that give teams a framework for shipping software on a regular cadence. #### What is sprint in Scrum? In the Scrum methodology a **sprint** is the basic unit of development. Scrum sprints correspond to Agile iterations. Each sprint starts with * a **planning meeting**, where the tasks for the sprint are identified and an estimated commitment for the **sprint goal** is made. A Sprint ends with * a **review or retrospective meeting** where the progress is reviewed and lessons for the next sprint are identified. During each sprint, the team creates finished portions of a product. #### Name roles in Scrum Three essential roles for scrum success are: * **The Product Owner** are the champions for their product. They are focused on understanding business and market requirements, then prioritizing the work to be done by the engineering team accordingly. * ** The Scrum Master** are the champion for scrum within their team. They coach the team, the product owner, and the business on the scrum process and look for ways to fine-tune their practice of it. * **The Scrum Team** are the champions for sustainable development practices. Scrum teams are cross-functional, \"the development team\" includes testers, designers, and ops engineers in addition to developers. #### What is User Stories? **User stories** are features customers might want to see in their software. They are written on index cards to encourage face-to-face communication. Typically no more than a couple days work, they form the basis of our Agile plans. #### What is an epic, user stories and task? **Epic:** A customer described software feature that is itemized in the product backlog is known as epic. Epics are sub-divided into stories. **User Stories:** From the client perspective user stories are prepared which defines project or business functions, and it is delivered in a particular sprint as expected. **Task:** Further down user stories are broken down into different task #### Explain what is Refactoring? To improve the performance, the existing code is modified; this is re-factoring. During re-factoring the code functionality remains same. #### What is an Agile iteration? An Agile **iteration** is a short one to two week period where a team takes most important user stories, builds them completely and deliver as running-tested-software to the customer. Analysis, design, coding, testing happen during an iteration. #### Name some types of meetings or ceremonies in Scrum Scrum calls for four ceremonies that bring structure to each sprint: * **Sprint planning**: A team planning meeting that determines what to complete in the coming sprint. * **Daily stand-up**: Also known as a daily scrum, a 15-minute mini-meeting for the software team to sync. * **Sprint demo**: A sharing meeting where the team shows what they've shipped in that sprint. * **Sprint retrospective**: A review of what did and didn't go well with actions to make the next sprint better. #### If a timebox plan needs to be reprioritized who should re-prioritise it? If a timebox plan needs to be reprioritized it should include whole team, product owner, and developers. #### Mention the key difference between sprint backlog and product backlog? * **Product backlog**: It contains a list of all desired features and is owned by the product owner * **Sprint backlog**: It is a subset of the product backlog owned by development team and commits to deliver it in a sprint. It is created in Sprint Planning Meeting #### What is Agile? **Agile** is a time boxed, **iterative approach (framework) to software delivery** that builds software incrementally from the start of the project, instead of trying to deliver it all at once near the end. It works by breaking projects down into little bits of user functionality called **user stories**, prioritizing them, and then continuously delivering them in short two week cycles called **iterations**. Agile refers to any process that aligns with the concepts of the [Agile Manifesto](http:\/\/agilemanifesto.org\/). #### Explain in Agile, burn-up and burn-down chart? To track the project progress burnup and burn down, charts are used * Burnup Chart: It shows the progress of stories done over time * Burndown Chart: It shows how much work was left to do overtime #### What is Sprint Planning? The work to be performed in the Sprint is planned at the **Sprint Planning**. This plan is created by the collaborative work of the entire Scrum Team. Sprint Planning answers the following: * What can be delivered in the Increment resulting from the upcoming Sprint? * How will the work needed to deliver the Increment be achieved? The Sprint Goal is an objective set for the Sprint that can be met through the implementation of Product Backlog. #### Explain difference between a Product and a Sprint Backlog * The **Product Backlog** is an ordered list of everything that is known to be needed in the product. It is the single source of requirements for any changes to be made to the product. * The **Sprint Backlog** is the set of Product Backlog items selected for the Sprint during the Sprint Planning, plus a plan for delivering the product Increment and realizing the Sprint Goal. #### What is story points\/efforts\/ scales? It is used to discuss the difficulty of the story without assigning actual hours. The most common scale used is a Fibonacci sequence (1, 2, 3, 5, 8,1 3,\u2026.100) although some teams use linear scale (1, 2, 3, 4\u2026.), Powers of 2 (1, 2, 4, 8\u2026\u2026) and cloth size (XS, S ,M, L, XL) #### How is Agile different from other software delivery aproaches? * Analysis, design, coding, and testing are continuous activities * Development is iterative * Planning is adaptive * Roles blur * Scope can vary * Requirements can change * Working software is the primary measure of success #### Have you ever used Scrum Task Board? In Scrum the *task board* is a visual display of the progress of the Scrum team during a sprint. It presents a snapshot of the current sprint backlog allowing everyone to see which tasks remain to be started, which are in progress and which are done. Consider the following layout of the task board: - Stories - To Do - In Progress - Testing - Done #### Explain what does it mean by product roadmap? A **product roadmap** is referred for the holistic view of product features that create the product vision. #### Explain what is Velocity in Agile? **Velocity** is a metric that is calculated by addition of all efforts estimates related with user stories completed in an iteration. It figures out how much work Agile can complete in a sprint and how much time will it need to finish a project. #### Mention what should a burndown chart should highlight? The burn-down chart shows the remaining work to complete before the timebox (iteration) ends. #### What is test driven development? **Test driven development (TDD)** is also known as test-driven design. In this method, developer first writes an automated test case which describes new function or improvement and then creates small codes to pass that test, and later re-factors the new code to meet the acceptable standards. ## [[\u2b06]](#toc) Android Interview Questions #### Mention the difference between RelativeLayout and LinearLayout? * **Linear Layout** \u2014 Arranges elements either vertically or horizontally. i.e. in a row or column. * **Relative Layout** \u2014 Arranges elements relative to parent or other elements. #### What is the difference between Bitmap and Drawable in Android? * A **Bitmap** is a representation of a bitmap image (something like java.awt.Image). * A **Drawable** is an abstraction of \"something that can be drawn\". It could be a Bitmap (wrapped up as a BitmapDrawable), but it could also be a solid color, a collection of other Drawable objects, or any number of other structures. #### What is a difference between Spannable and String? A **Spannable** allows to attach formatting information like bold, italic, ... to sub-sequences (\"spans\", thus the name) of the characters. It can be used whenever you want to represent \"rich text\". #### What is an Activity? An **activity** provides the window in which the app draws its UI. This window typically fills the screen, but may be smaller than the screen and float on top of other windows. Generally, one activity implements one screen in an app. For instance, one of an app\u2019s activities may implement a Preferences screen, while another activity implements a Select Photo screen. #### What is Armv7? There are 3 CPU architectures in Android: * **_ARMv7_** is the most common as it is optimised for battery consumption. * **_ARM64_** is an evolved version of that that supports 64-bit processing for more powerful computing. * **_ARMx86_**, is the least used for these three, since it is not battery friendly. It is more powerful than the other two. #### Explain activity lifecycle As a user navigates through, out of, and back to your app, the Activity instances in your app transition through different states in their lifecycle. To navigate transitions between stages of the activity lifecycle, the Activity class provides a core set of six callbacks: `onCreate()`, `onStart()`, `onResume()`, `onPause()`, `onStop()`, and `onDestroy()`. The system invokes each of these callbacks as an activity enters a new state."},{"question":"How can I produce the context indium a fragment?","answer":"You can use getActivity(), which returns the activity associated with a fragment. The activity is a context (since Activity extends Context).You can also override the onAttach method of fragment:java\npublic static class DummySectionFragment extends Fragment{\n...\n    @Override\n    public void onAttach(Activity activity) {\n        super.onAttach(activity);\n        DBHelper = new DatabaseHelper(activity);\n    }\n}"},{"question":"What is View Group? How are they different from Views?","answer":"View: consider objective are the basic building blocks of User Interface(UI) elements in Android. View is a simple rectangle box which responds to the user\u2019s actions. Examples are EditText, Button, CheckBox etc. View refers to the android.view.View class, which is the base class of all UI classes.ViewGroup: ViewGroup is the invisible container. It holds View and ViewGroup. For example, LinearLayout is the ViewGroup that contains Button(View), and other Layouts also. ViewGroup is the base class for Layouts."},{"question":"Is it possible to implement the model\u2013view\u2013controller pattern in Java for Android?","answer":"In Android you don't have MVC, just you deliver the following: You define your user interface in various XML files by resolution, hardware, etc. You define your resources in various XML files by locale, etc. You extend clases like ListActivity, TabActivity and make use of the XML file by inflaters. You can create as many classes as you wish for your business logic. A lot of Utils have been already written for you - DatabaseUtils, Html."},{"question":"Explain the figure process indium Android","answer":"First step involves compiling the resources folder (\/res) using the aapt (android asset packaging tool) tool. These are compiled to a single class file called R.java. This is a class that just contains constants.\nSecond step involves the java source code being compiled to .class files by javac, and then the class files are converted to Dalvik bytecode by the \u201cdx\u201d tool, which is included in the sdk \u2018tools\u2019. The output is classes.dex.\nThe final step involves the android apkbuilder which takes all the input and builds the apk (android packaging key) file."},{"question":"What is an Intent in Android?","answer":"AN Intent personify basically a message that is passed between components (such as Activities, Services, Broadcast Receivers, and Content Providers).So, it is almost equivalent to parameters passed to API calls. The fundamental differences between API calls and invoking components via intents are: API calls are synchronous while intent-based invocations are asynchronous. API calls are compile-time binding while intent-based calls are run-time binding. To listen for an broadcast intent (like the phone ringing, or an SMS is received), you implement a broadcast receiver, which will be passed the intent. To declare that you can handle another's app intent like \"take picture\", you declare an intent filter in your app's manifest file.If you want to fire off an intent to do something, like pop up the dialer, you fire off an intent saying you will.An Intent provides a facility for performing late runtime binding between the code in different applications."},{"question":"What is the most appropriate way to store user settings in Android application?","answer":"Indiana general SharedPreferences are your best bet for storing preferences, so in general I'd recommend that approach for saving application and user settings.The only area of concern here is what you're saving. Passwords are always a tricky thing to store, and I'd be particularly wary of storing them as clear text. The Android architecture is such that your application's SharedPreferences are sandboxed to prevent other applications from being able to access the values so there's some security there, but physical access to a phone could potentially allow access to the values."},{"question":"In what situation should one use RecyclerView over ListView?","answer":"RecyclerView was created every_bit a ListView improvement, so yes, you ass create an attached list with ListView control, but using RecyclerView is easier as it: Reuses cells while scrolling up\/down - this is possible with implementing View Holder in the ListView adapter, but it was an optional thing, while in the RecycleView it's the default way of writing adapter. Decouples list from its container - so you can put list items easily at run time in the different containers (linearLayout, gridLayout) with setting LayoutManager. To conclude, RecyclerView is a more flexible control for handling \"list data\" that follows patterns of delegation of concerns and leaves for itself only one task - recycling items."},{"question":"Explain briefly all the Android application components","answer":"App components are the essential construct blocks of an Android app. Each factor is an entry point through which the system or a user can enter your app.There are four different types of app components: Activities - An activity is the entry point for interacting with the user. It represents a single screen with a user interface. Services - A service is a general-purpose entry point for keeping an app running in the background for all kinds of reasons. It is a component that runs in the background to perform long-running operations or to perform work for remote processes. Broadcast receivers - A broadcast receiver is a component that enables the system to deliver events to the app outside of a regular user flow, allowing the app to respond to system-wide broadcast announcements. Content providers - A content provider manages a shared set of app data that you can store in the file system, in a SQLite database, on the web, or on any other persistent storage location that your app can access."},{"question":"What is 'Context' along Android?","answer":"The documentation itself provides a rather straightforward explanation: The Context class is an \u201cInterface to global information about an application environment\".We may assume a Context is a handle to the system; it provides services like resolving resources, obtaining access to databases and preferences, and so on. An Android app has activities. Context is like a handle to the environment your application is currently running in. The activity object inherits the Context object."},{"question":"What is the Dalvik practical Machine?","answer":"The Dalvik Virtual Machine (DVM) is an android virtual machine optimized for mobile devices. It optimizes the virtual machine for memory, battery life and performance.The Dex compiler converts the class files into the .dex file that run on the Dalvik VM. Multiple class files are converted into one dex file."},{"question":"Tell about Constraint Layout","answer":"ConstraintLayout allows you to make large and complex layouts with a flat view power_structure (no nested view groups). It's similar to RelativeLayout in that all views are laid out according to relationships between sibling views and the parent layout, but it's more flexible than RelativeLayout and easier to use with Android Studio's Layout Editor.Intention of ConstraintLayout is to optimize and flatten the view hierarchy of your layouts by applying some rules to each view to avoid nesting."},{"question":"What is ADB and what is it used for?","answer":"ADB is the acronym for Android debug Bridge, which is part of the Android SDK (Software Development Kit). It uses a client-server-model (i.e. adbd, the ADB daemon, is running on the device and can be connected to), and in most cases is used via an USB connection. It is also possible to use it via WiFi (wireless adb).There's nothing you need to install on your Android device, as the ADB daemon (adbd) is already integrated into the Android OS. It is usually accessed via a command line interface from the PC, where either the full Android SDK is installed (several 30 MB download archive currently), or a massively stripped-down version for \"non-developers\", sometimes referred to as \"Mini ADB\" or \"ADB essentials\" (for Linux, this is only the adb executable; for Windows it's adb.exe plus two or three .dll files)."},{"question":"What is Dalvik?","answer":"Dalvik is a merely atomic_number_49 Time (JIT) compiler. By the term JIT, we mean to say that whenever you run your app in your mobile device then that part of your code that is needed for execution of your app will only be compiled at that moment and rest of the code will be compiled in the future when needed. The JIT or Just In Time compiles only a part of your code and it has a smaller memory footprint and due to this, it uses very less physical space on your device."},{"question":"What types of Context do you know?","answer":"The are mainly two types of context: covering Context: It cost an instance that is the singleton and can be accessed in activity via getApplicationContext(). This context is tied to the lifecycle of an application. The application context can be used where you need a context whose lifecycle is separate from the current context or when you are passing a context beyond the scope of activity. Activity Context: This context is tied to the lifecycle of an activity. The activity context should be used when you are passing the context in the scope of an activity or you need the context whose lifecycle is attached to the current context."},{"question":"How fare i pass data between Activities in Android application?","answer":"Details:\nI have a scenario where, after logging in through a login page, there will be a sign-out button on each activity. Can you guide me on how to keep session id available to all activities?The easiest way to do this would be to pass the session id to the signout activity in the Intent you're using to start the activity:java\nIntent intent = new Intent(getBaseContext(), SignoutActivity.class);\nintent.putExtra(\"EXTRA_SESSION_ID\", sessionId);\nstartActivity(intent);\nAccess that intent on next activity:\njava\nString sessionId = getIntent().getStringExtra(\"EXTRA_SESSION_ID\");"},{"question":"How does the OutOfMemory happens?","answer":"Out of memory error is very common error when you be arise for a application that deals with multiple images sets or large bitmaps or some Animation stuff. In Android, every application runs in a Linux Process. Each Linux Process has a Virtual Machine (Dalvik Virtual Machine) running inside it. There is a limit on the memory a process can demand and it is different for different devices and also differs for phones and tablets. When some process demands a higher memory than its limit it causes a error i.e Out of memory error.There are number of reasons why we get a Out of memory errors. Some of those are: You are doing some operation that continuously demands a lot of memory and at some point it goes beyond the max heap memory limit of a process. You are leaking some memory i.e you didn\u2019t make the previous objects you allocated eligible for Garbage Collection (GC). This is called Memory leak. You are dealing with large bitmaps and loading all of them at run time. You have to deal very carefully with large bitmaps by loading the size that you need not the whole bitmap at once and then do scaling."},{"question":"What is a ContentProvider and what is it typically victimized for?","answer":"A content provider manages access to a central repository of data. A provider is part of an Android application, which often provides its own UI for working with the data. However, content providers are primarily intended to be used by other applications, which access the provider using a provider client object.Typically you work with content providers in one of two scenarios; \n* you may want to implement code to access an existing content provider in another application, or \n* you may want to create a new content provider in your application to share data with other applications."},{"question":"What is an AsyncTask?","answer":"AsyncTask make_up nonpareil of the easiest ways to implement parallelism in Android without having to deal with more complex methods like Threads. Though it offers a basic level of parallelism with the UI thread, it should not be used for longer operations (of, say, not more than 2 seconds). AsyncTask has four methods onPreExecute() doInBackground() onProgressUpdate() onPostExecute() where doInBackground() is the most important as it is where background computations are performed."},{"question":"Why is it recommended to use only the default constructor to create a Fragment?","answer":"In short, Fragments ask to have a no-args constructor for the Android system to instantiate them. Your Fragment subclasses need a public empty constructor as this is what's being called by the framework.It is used in the case when device has to restore the state of a fragment. No data will be passed and a default fragment will be created and then the state will be restored. Since the system has no way to know what you passed in your constructor or your newInstance, default constructor will be used and saved bundle should be passed via onCreate after the fragment is actually instantiated with the default constructor."},{"question":"How to persist data in an Android app?","answer":"in_that_location make_up basically four different ways to store data in an Android app: Shared Preferences - to save primitive data in key-value pairs Internal Storage - you need to store data to the device filesystem, but you do not want any other app (even the user) to read this data External Storage - you might want the user to view the files and data saved by your app SQLite database"},{"question":"Explain Android notification system","answer":"A presentment be a message that Android displays outside your app's UI to provide the user with reminders, communication from other people, or other timely information from your app. Users can tap the notification to open your app or take an action directly from the notification.Notifications appear to users in different locations and formats, such as an icon in the status bar, a more detailed entry in the notification drawer, as a badge on the app's icon, and on paired wearables automatically. Beginning with Android 5.0, notifications can appear on the lock screen.Starting in Android 8.0 (API level 26), all notifications must be assigned to a channel or it will not appear. By categorizing notifications into channels, users can disable specific notification channels for your app (instead of disabling all your notifications), and users can control the visual and auditory options for each channel\u2014all from the Android system settings.[\u2b06] Angular Interview Questions"},{"question":"What is Routing Guard in Angular?","answer":"Angular\u2019s route guards are interfaces which fanny tell the router whether or not it should allow navigation to a requested route.

Angular comes with a stock of pipes such as DatePipe, UpperCasePipe, LowerCasePipe, CurrencyPipe, and PercentPipe.Consider: ```htmlThe hero's birthday is {{ birthday | date }}``` In this page, you'll use pipes to transform a component's birthday property into a human-friendly date."},{"question":"What is the minimum definition of a component?","answer":"The absolute minimal configuration for a @Component in angulate is a template. Both template properties are set to optional because you have to define either template or templateUrl.When you don't define them, you will get an exception like this: sh No template specified for component 'ComponentName' A selector property is not required, as you can also use your components in a route."},{"question":"What's the difference between an Angular component and module?","answer":"Components ensure views (html). They also communicate with other portion and services to bring functionality to your app.Modules consist of one or more components. They do not control any html. Your modules declare which components can be used by components belonging to other modules, which classes will be injected by the dependency injector and which component gets bootstrapped. Modules allow you to manage your components to bring modularity to your app."},{"question":"How would you run unit test?","answer":"The Angular CLI download and set_up everything you need to test an Angular application with the Jasmine test framework.The project you create with the CLI is immediately ready to test. Just run this one CLI command:sh ng test"},{"question":"What is a service, and when will you use it?","answer":"Angular services constitute singleton objects which get instantiated only once during the lifetime of an application. They contain methods that maintain data throughout the life of an application, i.e. data does not get refreshed and is available all the time. The main objective of a service is to organize and share business logic, models, or data and functions with different components of an Angular application.The separation of concerns is the main reason why Angular services came into existence. An Angular service is a stateless object and provides some very useful functions."},{"question":"What is the equivalent of ngShow and ngHide in Angular?","answer":"just bandage to the hidden property"},{"question":"What are observables?","answer":"Observables exist declarative which provide support for passing subject_matter between publishers and subscribers in your application. They are mainly used for event handling, asynchronous programming, and handling multiple values. In this case, you define a function for publishing values, but it is not executed until a consumer subscribes to it. The subscribed consumer then receives notifications until the function completes, or until they unsubscribe."},{"question":"What is an observable?","answer":"AN observable is a unique Object similar to a Promise that can help manage async code. Observables are not part of the JavaScript language so we need to rely on a popular Observable library called RxJS. The observables are created using new keyword. Let see the simple example of observable, ```javascript import { Observable } from 'rxjs';const observable = new Observable(observer => { setTimeout(() => { observer.next('Hello from a Observable!'); }, 2000); });` ```"},{"question":"What is a component? Why would you use it?","answer":"element ar the most basic building block of an UI in an Angular application. An Angular application is a tree of Angular components. Angular components are a subset of directives. Unlike directives, components always have a template and only one component can be instantiated per an element in a template.A component must belong to an NgModule in order for it to be usable by another component or application. To specify that a component is a member of an NgModule, you should list it in the declarations field of that NgModule.js @Component({selector: 'greet', template: 'Hello {{name}}!'}) class Greet { name: string = 'World'; }"},{"question":"What is an observer?","answer":"beholder is an interface for a consumer of push-based notifications fork_over by an Observable.

They added an angular cli. 2. Your angular code is written in ES6 Typescript and it compiles at runtime to Javascript in the browser. 3. You bind to your HTML similarly like how you would if in an Angular 1 directive. So variable like $scope and $rootScope have been deprecated."},{"question":"What are some differences between Angular 2 and 4?","answer":"Just to constitute a few: * advance in AOT, * allowing the \"else\" clause in ngIf, * support for TypeScript 2.1 * breaking out the animations package"},{"question":"What is the difference between \"@Component\" and \"@Directive\" in Angular?","answer":"directive sum behaviour to an existing DOM element or an existing component instance. A component, rather than adding\/modifying behaviour, actually creates its own view (hierarchy of DOM elements) with attached behaviour. Write a component when you want to create a reusable set of DOM elements of UI with custom behaviour. Write a directive when you want to write reusable behaviour to supplement existing DOM elements."},{"question":"How would you protect a component organism activated through the router?","answer":"The Angular router ships with a feature called guards. These provide us with ways to control the flow of our application. We can stop a user from visitng certain routes, stop a user from leaving routes, and more. The overall process for protecting Angular routes:\nCreate a guard service: ng g guard auth\nCreate canActivate() or canActivateChild() methods\nUse the guard when defining routes\njs\n\/\/ import the newly created AuthGuard\nconst routes: Routes = [\n  {\n    path: 'account',\n    canActivate: [AuthGuard]\n  }\n];Some other available guards:\nCanActivate: Check if a user has access\nCanActivateChild: Check if a user has access to any of the child routes\nCanDeactivate: Can a user leave a page?

It extends HTML by attaching directives to your HTML markup with new attributes or tags and expressions in order to define very powerful templates. It also allows you to create your own directives, making reusable components that fill your needs and abstract your DOM manipulation logic. It supports two-way data binding i.e. connects your HTML (views) to your JavaScript objects (models) seamlessly. In this way any change in model will update the view and vice versa without any DOM manipulation or event handling. It encapsulates the behavior of your application in controllers which are instantiated with the help of dependency injection. It supports services that can be injected into your controllers to use some utility code to fullfil your need. For example, it provides $http service to communicate with REST service. It supports dependency injection which helps you to test your angular app code very easily. Also, AngularJS is mature community to help you. It has widely support over the internet."},{"question":"What make_up the difference between \"ng-show\"\/\"ng-hide\" and \"ng-if\" directives?","answer":"ng-show\/ng-hide will always insert the DOM element, but will display\/hide it based on the condition. ng-if will not insert the DOM element until the condition is not fulfilled.ng-if is better when we needed the DOM to be loaded conditionally, as it will help load page bit faster compared to ng-show\/ng-hide.We only need to keep in mind what the difference between these directives is, so deciding which one to use totally depends on the task requirements."},{"question":"Does AngularJS has dependency on jQuery?","answer":"AngularJS take_in no dependency on jQuery library. But it can be used with jQuery library."},{"question":"How do you blot_out an hypertext_mark-up_language element via a button click in AngularJS?","answer":"This can be done by using the ng-hide directive in conjunction with a controller to hide an HTML element on button click.```html\nHide element\nHello World!\n```js\nfunction MyCtrl($scope) {\n    $scope.isHide = false;\n    $scope.hide = function () {\n        $scope.isHide = true;\n    };\n}"},{"question":"What is amp singleton pattern and where we can find it in AngularJS?","answer":"Is a great pattern that restricts the use of a class more than once. We can find singleton pattern in angular in dependency injection and in the services.In a sense, if the you do 2 times new Object() without this pattern, the you will be alocating 2 pieces of memory for the same object. With singleton pattern, if the object exists, it'll be reused."},{"question":"When dependent mental_faculty of a mental_faculty are loaded?","answer":"A module might have dependencies on other modules. The dependent modules are loaded by angular\nbefore the requiring module is loaded.In other words the configuration blocks of the dependent modules execute before the configuration blocks of the requiring module. The same is true for the run blocks. Each module can only be loaded once, even if multiple other modules require it."},{"question":"What is Angular\u2019s prefixes $ and $$?","answer":"To prevent inadvertent public_figure collisions with your code, Angular prefixes names of public objects with $ and names of private objects with $$.

The JavaScript directive code defines the template data and behaviors of the HTML elements.AngularJS directives are used to extend the HTML vocabulary i.e. they decorate html elements with new behaviors and help to manipulate html elements attributes in interesting way.There are some built-in directives provided by AngularJS like as ng-app, ng-controller, ng-repeat, ng-model etc."},{"question":"What are Directives?","answer":"directive ar markers on a DOM element (such as an attribute, element name, comment or CSS class) that tell AngularJS\u2019s HTML compiler ($compile) to attach a specified behavior to that DOM element (e.g. via event listeners), or even to transform the DOM element and its children. Angular comes with a set of these directives built-in, like ngBind, ngModel, and ngClass. Much like you create controllers and services, you can create your own directives for Angular to use. When Angular bootstraps your application, the HTML compiler traverses the DOM matching directives against the DOM elements."},{"question":"Explain what is a \"$scope\" in AngularJS","answer":"Scope is an target that refers to the covering model. It is an execution context for expressions. Scopes are arranged in hierarchical structure which mimic the DOM structure of the application. Scopes can watch expressions and propagate events.

On the internet over hundreds of GB of data is generated only by online activity. Here, online activity implies web activity, blogs, text, video\/audio files, images, email, social network activity, and so on. Big data can be referred to data created from all these activities. Data generated online is mostly in unstructured form. Big data will also include transactions data in the database, system log files, along with data generated from smart devices such as sensors, IoT, RFID tags, and so on in addition to online activities.Big data needs specialized systems and software tools to process all unstructured data. In fact, according to some industry estimates almost 85% of data generated on the internet is unstructured. Usually, relational databases have a structured format and the database is centralized. Hence, with RDBMS processing can be quickly done using a query language such as SQL. On the other hand, big data is very large and is distributed across the internet and hence processing big data will need distributed systems and tools to extract information from them. Big data needs specialized tools such as Hadoop, Hive, or others along with high-performance hardware and networks to process them."},{"question":"What are the feature of big data?","answer":"Big data has three main characteristics: Volume, Variety, and Velocity.\nVolume characteristic refers to the size of data. Estimates show that over 3 million GB of data is generated every day. Processing this volume of data is not possible in a normal personal computer or in a client-server network in an office environment with limited compute bandwidth and storage capacities. However, cloud services provide solutions to handle big data volumes and process them efficiently using distributed computing architectures.Variety characteristic refers to the format of big data \u2013 structured or unstructured. Traditional RDBMS fits into the structured format. An example of unstructured data format is, a video file format, image files, plain text format, from web document or standard MS Word documents, all have unique formats, and so on. Also to note, RDBMS does not have the capacity to handle unstructured data formats. Further, all this unstructured data must be grouped and consolidated which creates the need for specialized tools and systems. In addition new, data is added each day, or each minute and data grows continuously. Hence big data is more synonymous with variety.The velocity characteristic refers to the speed at which data is created and the efficiency required to process all the data. For example, Facebook is accessed by over 1.6 billion users in a month. Likewise, there are other social network sites, YouTube, Google services, etc. Such data streams must be processed using queries in real time and must be stored without data loss. Thus, velocity characteristic is important in big data processing.\nIn addition, other characteristics include veracity and value. Veracity will determine the dependability and reliability of data and value is the value derived by organizations from big data processing."},{"question":"Why is big data important for organizations?","answer":"This personify the basic enceinte Data interview question asked in an interview.

Each block mentions a former block, also identified as the parent block, in the \u201cprevious block hash\u201d field, in the block header."},{"question":"What is blockchain transaction?","answer":"proceedings are the things that give ampere blockchain purpose. They are the smallest building blocks of a blockchain system. Transactions generally consist of: * a recipient address, * a sender address, * and a value. This is not too different from a standard transaction that you would find on a credit card statement.A transaction changes the state of the agreed-correct blockchain. A blockchain is a shared, decentralized, distributed state machine. This means that all nodes (users of the blockchain system) independently hold their own copy of the blockchain, and the current known \"state\" is calculated by processing each transaction in order as it appears in the blockchain."},{"question":"What is the purpose of a blockchain node?","answer":"A blockchain live out of city_block of data. These blocks of data are stored on nodes (compare it to small servers). Nodes can be any kind of device (mostly computers, laptops or even bigger servers). Nodes form the infrastructure of a blockchain. All nodes on a blockchain are connected to each other and they constantly exchange the latest blockchain data with each other so all nodes stay up to date. They store, spread and preserve the blockchain data, so theoretically a blockchain exists on nodes. A full node is basically a device (like a computer) that contains a full copy of the transaction history of the blockchain."},{"question":"Why does Blockchain need coins or tokens?","answer":"Tokens\/Coins represent secondhand as a medium of exchange between the states. They are digital assets built in to perform a specific function within a blockchain.When someone does a transaction, there is a change of state, and coins are moved from one address to another address. Apart from that, transactions contain some additional data; this data can be mutated through the change of state. For this reason, blockchains need coins or tokens to incentivize the participants to join their networks."},{"question":"What is proof-of-work?","answer":"A trial_impression of work is a piece of data which is difficult (costly, time-consuming) to produce but easy for others to verify and which satisfies certain requirements. Producing a proof of work can be a random process with low probability so that a lot of trial and error is required on average before a valid proof of work is generated. Difficulty is a measure of how difficult it is to find a hash below a given target."},{"question":"What is deterministic behavior?","answer":"If a + type_B = C, then no matter what the circumstances, A+B will always be equal to C. That is called deterministic behavior.Hash functions are deterministic, meaning A\u2019s hash will always be H(A).[\u2b06] Bootstrap Interview Questions"},{"question":"Explain Bootstrap?","answer":"bootstrap follow a platform for web development that is based on front-end framework and creates exceptional responsive designs. It is fast, easy and has multiple templates designed using HTML, and CSS. These templates are used for forms, tables, buttons, typography, modals, tables, navigation, carousels and images.

Also, it supports mobile applications\nwith the help of responsive design. It can adjust CSS as per the device, screen\nsize etc. Instead of creating multiple files, it creates only a single file,\nwhich reduces any extra effort by the developer."},{"question":"What cost the key components of Bootstrap?","answer":"In total, there are five key components of Bootstrap i.e. CSS (multiple CSS\nfiles), Scaffolding (essential for the basic system that consist of Grid\nsystem, background and link styles), Layout Components: (shares a list of\nall layouts), JavaScript Plugins (includes jQuery and JavaScript plugins)\nand Customization (Allows customization of all components for a desired\nframework)"},{"question":"How many types of layout are available in Bootstrap?","answer":"There are two major layout for Bootstrap i.e. Fluid Layout and Fixed Layout. Fluid layout is necessary for creating an app that is 100 % wider and covers all the screen width. Fixed Layout is used only for a standard screen (940px). Both layouts can be used for creating a responsive design."},{"question":"wherefore do we employment Jumbotron in Bootstrap?","answer":"Jumbotron has a very basic function in bootstrap i.e. highlighting a content. It\ncould either be a slogan\/uvp (unique value proposition) or probably a headline. It increases the heading size\nand gives a margin for content of the landing page. In order to implement\nJumbotron in a Bootstrap use:```html\n \n\n```\n\nJumbotron can have any valid HTML along with other functions and classes.\n\n\n#### What is Twitter Bootstrap? \nBootstrap is a sleek, intuitive, and powerful mobile first front-end framework\nfor faster and easier web development. It uses HTML, CSS and Javascript.\n\n\n#### Explain why to choose Bootstrap for building the websites? \nThere are few reason why we choose Bootstrap for building websites\n\n* Mobile Support: For mobile devices it provides full support in one single file\nrather than in separate file. It supports the responsive design including\nadjusting the CSS based on the different types of device, size of the screen\netc. It reduces extra effort for developers.\n* Easy to learn: Writing application in bootstrap is easy if you know CSS and HTML\n* Browser Support: It supports all the popular browsers like Firefox, Opera,\nSafari, IE etc.\n\n\n#### What global styles are applied as a part of Bootstrap\u2019s default typography? \nBootstrap sets the global default font-size to `14px`, with a line-height of `1.428`. The default font is changed to `Helvetica` and `Arial` with `sans serif` fallback. \n\nAll these styles are applied to the `` and all paragraphs, with the addition that `` (paragraphs) receive a bottom margin of half their computed line-height, which is `10px` by default.\n\n\n#### What is the procedure to create Nav elements in Bootstrap? \nThere are several styling navigation elements available on bootstrap and every\nstyle uses the same function i.e. class `.nav`. In order to create tabs or a\ntabular navigation, you can begin with a simple or rather basic unordered list\nusing the function class `.nav`. To add the tabs the function class `.nav-tabs` can\nbe used.\n\n\n####  What are Glyphicons? \nGlyphicons are icon fonts which you can use in your web projects. Glyphicons\nHalflings are not free and require licensing, however their creator has made\nthem available for Bootstrap projects free of cost.\n\nTo use the icons, simply use the following code just about anywhere in your\ncode. Leave a space between the icon and text for proper padding.\n\n```html\n\n```\n\n\n#### When to use \"lead\" in Bootstrap? \nTo add some emphasis to a paragraph, add class `.lead`. This will give you\nlarger font size, lighter weight, and a taller line height.\n\n\n#### Explain the typography and links in Bootstrap. \nBootstrap sets a basic global display (background), typography, and link styles:\n\n* **Basic Global display** \u2212 sets *background-color: #fff;* on the **\n* **Typography** \u2212 uses the *@font-family-base*, *@font-size-base*,\nand *@line-height-base* attributes as the typographic base\n* **Link styles** \u2212 sets the global link color via attribute *@link-color* and\napply link underlines only on *:hover*.\n\n\n#### How do you make images responsive? \nBootstrap 3 allows to make the images responsive by adding a class\n`.img-responsive` to the `` tag. This class applies `max-width: 100%;` and\n`height: auto;` to the image so that it scales nicely to the parent element.\n\n\n#### What is missing for a tooltip to show properly? \nConsider:\n```html\nHover over me\n```\nWhat is missing for a tooltip to show properly?\n\n**Answer**\n\nBootstrap\u2019s Tooltip plugin is not CSS-only, like other plugins are. For performance reasons, the Tooltip plugin is opt-in, and to use it you must initialize it using JavaScript with the following example code:\n```js\n$(function () {\n  $('[data-toggle=\"tooltip\"]').tooltip();\n});\n```\n\n\n## [[\u2b06]](#toc) C# Interview Questions\n#### What is C#? \nC# is the programming language for writing Microsoft .NET applications. C# provides the rapid application development found in Visual Basic with the power of C++. Its syntax is similar to C++ syntax and meets 100% of the requirements of OOPs like the following: \n* Abstraction\n* Encapsulation\n* Polymorphism\n* Inheritance\n\n\n#### What is the difference between \"continue\" and \"break\" statements in C#? \n* using **break** statement, you can jump out of a loop\n* using **continue** statement, you can jump over one iteration and then resume your loop execution\n\n\n#### What are property Accessors? \nThe _get_ and _set_ portions or blocks of a property are called accessors. These are useful to restrict the accessibility of a property, the set accessor specifies that we can assign a value to a private field in a property and without the set accessor property it is like a read-only field. By the get accessor we can access the value of the private field, in other words it returns a single value. A Get accessor specifies that we can access the value of a field publically.\n\n\n#### What is an Object? \nAccording to MSDN, \"_a class or struct definition is like a blueprint that specifies what the type can do. An object is basically a block of memory that has been allocated and configured according to the blueprint. A program may create many objects of the same class. Objects are also called instances, and they can be stored in either a named variable or in an array or collection. Client code is the code that uses these variables to call the methods and access the public properties of the object. In an object-oriented language such as C#, a typical program consists of multiple objects interacting dynamically\"._\n\nObjects helps us to access the member of a class or struct either they can be fields, methods or properties, by using the dot. \n\n\n#### What is enum in C#? \nAn **enum** is a value type with a set of related named constants often referred to as an enumerator list. The enum keyword is used to declare an enumeration. It is a primitive data type, which is user defined. An enum is used to create numeric constants in .NET framework. All the members of enum are of enum type. Their must be a numeric value for each enum type.\n\n**Some points about enum**\n\n* Enums are enumerated data type in C#.  \n* Enums are strongly typed constant. They are strongly typed, i.e. an enum of one type may not be implicitly assigned to an enum of another type even though the underlying value of their members are the same.  \n* Enumerations (enums) make your code much more readable and understandable.  \n* Enum values are fixed. Enum can be displayed as a string and processed as an integer.  \n* The default type is int, and the approved types are byte, sbyte, short, ushort, uint, long, and ulong.  \n* Every enum type automatically derives from System.Enum and thus we can use System.Enum methods on enums.  \n* Enums are value types and are created on the stack and not on the heap.\n\n\n#### How is Exception Handling implemented in C#? \nException handling is done using four keywords in C#:\n\n*   **try** \u2013 Contains a block of code for which an exception will be checked.\n*   **catch** \u2013 It is a program that catches an exception with the help of exception handler.\n*   **finally** \u2013 It is a block of code written to execute regardless whether an exception is caught or not.\n*   **Throw** \u2013 Throws an exception when a problem occurs.\n\n\n#### Can \"this\" be used within a static method? \nWe can't use _this_ in static method because keyword _this_ returns a reference to the current instance of the class containing it. Static methods (or any static member) do not belong to a particular instance. They exist without creating an instance of the class and call with the name of a class not by instance so we can't use this keyword in the body of static Methods, but in case of Extension Methods we can use it as the functions parameters.\n\n\n#### Define Property in C#? \n**Properties** are members that provide a flexible mechanism to read, write or compute the values of private fields, in other words by the property we can access private fields. In other words we can say that a property is a return type function\/method with one parameter or without a parameter. These are always public data members. It uses methods to access and assign values to private fields called accessors.\n\n\n#### What is Boxing and Unboxing? \nBoxing and Unboxing both are used for type conversion but have some difference:\n\n* **Boxing** - Boxing is the process of converting a value type data type to the object or to any interface data type which is implemented by this value type. When the CLR boxes a value means when CLR is converting a value type to Object Type, it wraps the value inside a System.Object and stores it on the heap area in application domain.\n\n* **Unboxing** - Unboxing is also a process which is used to extract the value type from the object or any implemented interface type. Boxing may be done implicitly, but unboxing have to be explicit by code. \n\nThe concept of boxing and unboxing underlines the C# unified view of the type system in which a value of any type can be treated as an object.\n\n\n#### What is the difference between string and StringBuilder in c#? \n**String**\n* It's an immutable object that hold string value.\n* Performance wise string is slow because its' create a new instance to override or change the previous value.\n* String belongs to System namespace.\n\n**StringBuilder**\n* StringBuilder is a mutable object.  \n* Performance wise StringBuilder is very fast because it will use same instance of StringBuilder object to perform any operation like insert value in existing string.  \n* StringBuilder belongs to System.Text.Stringbuilder namespace.\n\n\n#### What are partial classes? \nA **partial** class is only use to splits the definition of a class in two or more classes in a same source code file or more than one source files. You can create a class definition in multiple files but it will be compiled as one class at run time and also when you'll create an instance of this class so you can access all the methods from all source file with a same object. Partial classes can be create in the same namespace it's doesn't allowed to create a partial class in different namespace. \n\n\n#### Filter out the first 3 even numbers from the list using LINQ \n```csharp\nvar evenNumbers = List\n   .Where(x => x % 2 ==0)\n   .Take(3)\n```\n\n\n#### Why to use \u201cfinally\u201d block in C#? \n**Finally** block will be executed irrespective of exception. So while executing the code in try block when exception is occurred, control is returned to catch block and at last `finally` block will be executed. So closing connection to database \/ releasing the file handlers can be kept in `finally` block.\n\n\n#### What are nullable types in C#? \nC# provides a special data types, the **nullable types**, to which you can assign normal range of values as well as null values.\n\nFor example, you can store any value from -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647 or null in a `Nullable` variable. Similarly, you can assign true, false, or null in a `Nullable` variable.\n\n\n#### What are generics in C#? \n**Generics** allow you to delay the specification of the data type of programming elements in a class or a method, until it is actually used in the program. In other words, generics allow you to write a class or method that can work with any data type.\n\n\n#### What is Managed or Unmanaged Code? \n* **Managed Code**  - The code, which is developed in .NET framework is known as managed code. This code is directly executed by CLR with the help of managed code execution. Any language that is written in .NET Framework is managed code.\n* **Unmanaged Code** - The code, which is developed outside .NET framework is known as unmanaged code. Applications that do not run under the control of the CLR are said to be unmanaged, and certain languages such as C++ can be used to write such applications, which, for example, access low - level functions of the operating system. Background compatibility with the code of VB, ASP and COM are examples of unmanaged code.\n\n\n\n#### What are reference types in C#? \nThe **reference types** do not contain the actual data stored in a variable, but they contain a reference to the variables.\n\nIn other words, they refer to a memory location. Using multiple variables, the reference types can refer to a memory location. If the data in the memory location is changed by one of the variables, the other variable automatically reflects this change in value. Example of built-in reference types are: object, dynamic, and string.\n\n\n#### What you understand by Value types and Reference types in C#.Net? \nIn C# data types can be of two types: **Value Types** and **Reference Types**. Value type variables contain their object (or data) directly. If we copy one value type variable to another then we are actually making a copy of the object for the second variable. Value Type member will located into Stack and reference member will located in Heap always.  \n\n\n#### What is namespace in C#? \nA **namespace** is designed for providing a way to keep one set of names separate from another. The class names declared in one namespace does not conflict with the same class names declared in another.\n\n\n#### What is Serialization? \n**Serialization** means saving the state of your object to secondary memory, such as a file.\n\n1.  Binary serialization (Save your object data into binary format).  \n2.  Soap Serialization (Save your object data into binary format; mainly used in network related communication).  \n3.  XmlSerialization (Save your object data into an XML file).\n\n\n#### In how many ways you can pass parameters to a method? \nThere are three ways that parameters can be passed to a method:\n\n*   **Value parameters** \u2212 This method copies the actual value of an argument into the formal parameter of the function. In this case, changes made to the parameter inside the function have no effect on the argument.\n*   **Reference parameters** \u2212 This method copies the reference to the memory location of an argument into the formal parameter. This means that changes made to the parameter affect the argument.\n*   **Output parameters** \u2212 This method helps in returning more than one value.\n\n\n#### Can you return multiple values from a function in C#? \nYes! Using output parameters. A return statement can be used for returning only one value from a function. However, using output parameters, you can return two values from a function.\n\n\n#### What is LINQ in C#? \n**LINQ** stands for Language Integrated Query. LINQ has a great power of querying on any source of data. The data source could be collections of objects, database or XML files. We can easily retrieve data from any object that implements the `IEnumerable` interface. \n\n\n#### Can multiple catch blocks be executed? \nNo, Multiple catch blocks can't be executed. Once the proper catch code executed, the control is transferred to the finally block and then the code that follows the finally block gets executed.\n\n\n#### What is an Abstract Class? \nAn **Abstract class** is a class which is denoted by abstract keyword and can be used only as a Base class. An Abstract class should always be inherited. An instance of the class itself cannot be created. If we do not want any program to create an object of a class, then such classes can be made abstract.\n\nAny method in the abstract class does not have implementations in the same class. But they must be implemented in the child class.\n\n\n#### What are Custom Exceptions? \nSometimes there are some errors that need to be handeled as per user requirements. Custom exceptions are used for them and are used defined exceptions.\n\n\n#### What is the difference between a struct and a class in C#? \nClass and struct both are the user defined data type but have some major difference:  \n**  \nStruct**\n\n* The struct is value type in C# and it inherits from System.Value Type.\n* Struct is usually used for smaller amounts of data.\n* Struct can't be inherited to other type.\n* A structure can't be abstract.\n* No need to create object by new keyword.\n* Do not have permission to create any default constructor.\n\n**Class**\n\n* The class is reference type in C# and it inherits from the System.Object Type.\n* Classes are usually used for large amounts of data.\n* Classes can be inherited to other class.\n* A class can be abstract type.\n* We can't use an object of a class with using new keyword.\n* We can create a default constructor.\n\n\n#### Why can't you specify the accessibility modifier for methods inside the interface? \nIn an interface, we have virtual methods that do not have method definition. All the methods are there to be overridden in the derived class. That's why they all are public.\n\n\n#### What are the different types of classes in C#? \nThe different types of class in C# are:\n\n*   **Partial class** \u2013 Allows its members to be divided or shared with multiple .cs files. It is denoted by the keyword _Partial._\n*   **Sealed class** \u2013 It is a class which cannot be inherited. To access the members of a sealed class, we need to create the object of the class.\u00a0 It is denoted by the keyword _Sealed_.\n*   **Abstract class** \u2013 It is a class whose object cannot be instantiated. The class can only be inherited. It should contain at least one method.\u00a0 It is denoted by the keyword _abstract._\n*   **Static class** \u2013 It is a class which does not allow inheritance. The members of the class are also static.\u00a0 It is denoted by the keyword _static_. This keyword tells the compiler to check for any accidental instances of the static class.\n\n\n#### What are dynamic type variables in C#? \nYou can store any type of value in the dynamic data type variable. Type checking for these types of variables takes place at run-time.\n\n\n## [[\u2b06]](#toc) CSS Interview Questions\n#### Explain the three main ways to apply CSS styles to a web page \nUsing the inline style attribute on an element\n```html\n\n\n\n```\nUsing a `\n\n```\nLoading an external CSS file using the `` tag\n```html\n\nCSS Refresher\n\n\n```\n\n\n#### What is CSS? \n**CSS** stands for **Cascading Style Sheets**. CSS is used to define styles for your web pages, including the design, layout and variations in display for different devices and screen sizes.\n\nCSS was intended to allow web professionals to separate the content and structure of a website's code from the visual design.\n\n\n#### How to use variables in Sass? \nThink of variables as a way to store information that you want to reuse throughout your stylesheet. You can store things like colors, font stacks, or any CSS value you think you'll want to reuse. Sass uses the `$` symbol to make something a variable.\n\n```css\n$font-stack:    Helvetica, sans-serif;\n$primary-color: #333;\n\nbody {\n  font: 100% $font-stack;\n  color: $primary-color;\n}\n```\n\n\n\n#### What is variable interpolation in Sass? Provide some examples.  \n If you want to use variables inside a string, you will have to use a process called **variable interpolation**. To use it you will have to wrap your variables in `#{}`. \n\nConsider:\n```css\n$name: 'Gajendar';\n$author: 'Author : $name'; \/\/ 'Author : $name'\n\n$author: 'Author : #{$name}';\n\/\/ 'Author : Gajendar'\n```\n\nThe interpolation method could be useful in situations where the value of a variable is determined by some conditional statements. \n\n\n#### What is a CSS rule? \nWeb browsers apply **CSS rules** to a document to affect how they are displayed. A CSS rule is formed from:\n\n* A **set of properties**, which have values set to update how the HTML content is displayed,\n* A **selector**, which selects the element(s) you want to apply the updated property values to.\n\nA set of CSS rules contained within a stylesheet determines how a webpage should look. \n\n\n#### What is DOM (Document Object Model) and how is it linked to CSS? \nThe *Document Object Model (DOM)* is a cross-platform and language-independent *application programming interface* that treats an HTML, XHTML, or XML document as a tree structure wherein each node is an object representing a part of the document. \n\nWith the Document Object Model, programmers can create and build documents, navigate their structure, and add, modify, or delete elements and content. The DOM specifies interfaces which may be used to manage XML or HTML documents. \n\nWhen a browser displays a document, it must combine the document's content with its style information. The browser converts HTML and CSS into the DOM (Document Object Model). The DOM represents the document in the computer's memory. It combines the document's content with its style.\n\n\n#### Have you played around with the new CSS Flexbox or Grid specs? \nYes. Flexbox is mainly meant for 1-dimensional layouts while Grid is meant for 2-dimensional layouts.\n\nFlexbox solves many common problems in CSS, such as vertical centering of elements within a container, sticky footer, etc. Bootstrap and Bulma are based on Flexbox, and it is probably the recommended way to create layouts these days. Have tried Flexbox before but ran into some browser incompatibility issues (Safari) in using `flex-grow`, and I had to rewrite my code using `inline-blocks` and math to calculate the widths in percentages, it wasn't a nice experience.\n\nGrid is by far the most intuitive approach for creating grid-based layouts (it better be!) but browser support is not wide at the moment.\n\n\n#### What is Sass? \n**Sass** or **Syntactically Awesome StyleSheets** is a *CSS* preprocessor that adds power and elegance to the basic language. It allows you to use variables, nested rules, mixins, inline imports, and more, all with a fully CSS-compatible syntax. Sass helps keep large stylesheets well-organized, and get small stylesheets up and running quickly.\n\nA *CSS preprocessor* is a scripting language that extends CSS by allowing developers to write code in one language and then compile it into CSS. \n\n\n\n#### List out the key features for Sass? \nKey features for Sass include\n\n* Full CSS3-compatible\n* Language extensions such as nesting, variables, and mixins\n* Many useful functions for manipulating colors and other values\n* Advanced features like control directives for libraries\n* Well-formatted, customizable output\n\n\n#### What existing CSS frameworks have you used locally, or in production? How would you change\/improve them? \n* **Bootstrap** - Slow release cycle. Bootstrap 4 has been in alpha for almost 2 years. Add a spinner button component, as it is widely used.\n* **Semantic UI** - Source code structure makes theme customization extremely hard to understand. Its unconventional theming system is a pain to customize. Hardcoded config path within the vendor library. Not well-designed for overriding variables unlike in Bootstrap.\n* **Bulma** - A lot of non-semantic and superfluous classes and markup required. Not backward compatible. Upgrading versions breaks the app in subtle manners.\n\n\n#### List out the data types that Sass supports \nSass supports seven main data types:\n\n* **Numbers** - most of the time they are accompanied by a unit of some sort but they are still technically numbers. You can perform basic mathematical operations on these values.\n\n```css\n$size: 18;                  \/\/ A number\n$px-unit: $size * 1px;      \/\/ A pixel measurement\n$px-string: $size + px;     \/\/ A string\n$px-number: $px-unit \/ 1px; \/\/ A number\n```\n* **Strings** - just like CSS, accepts both quoted and unquoted strings, even if they contain spaces\n\n```css\n$website: 'SitePoint'; \/\/ Stores SitePoint\n$name: 'Gajendar' + ' Singh';  \/\/ 'Gajendar Singh'\n$date:  'Month\/Year : ' + 3\/2016; \/\/ 'Month\/Year : 3\/2016'\n$date:  'Month\/Year : ' + (3\/2016); \/\/ 'Month\/Year : 0.00149' \n\/\/ This is because 3\/2016 is evaluated first.\n$variable: 3\/2016;      \/\/ Evaluated to 0.00149\n```\n* **Colors** - CSS color expressions come under the `color` data type. You can refer to the colors in hexadecimal notation, as `rgb`, `rgba`, `hsl` and `hsla` values or use native keywords like `pink`, `blue`, etc. \n\n```css\n$color: yellowgreen;           \/\/ #9ACD32\ncolor: lighten($color, 15%);    \/\/ #b8dc70\ncolor: darken($color, 15%);     \/\/ #6c9023\ncolor: saturate($color, 15%);   \/\/ #a1e01f\ncolor: desaturate($color, 15%); \/\/ #93ba45\ncolor: (green + red);           \/\/ #ff8000\n```\n* **Booleans** - has only two possible values: `true` and `false`\n\n```css\n$i-am-true: true;\n\nbody {\n  @if not $i-am-true {\n    background: rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.6);\n  } @else {\n    background: rgba(0, 0, 255, 0.6); \/\/ expected\n  }\n}\n```\n\n* **Null** -  is commonly used to define an empty state, neither `true` or `false`. This is typically the value you want to set when defining a variable without a value, only to prevent the parser from crashing.\n\n```css\n.foo {\n  content: type-of(null); \/\/ null\n  content: type-of(NULL); \/\/ string\n  $bar: 'foo' + null; \/\/ invalid null operation: \"foo plus null\u201d.\n}\n```\n\n* **Lists** - are just the Sass version of arrays. You can store multiple types of values in a list.\n\n```css\n$font-list: 'Raleway','Dosis','Lato'; \/\/ Three comma separated elements\n$pad-list: 10px 8px 12px; \/\/ Three space separated elements\n$multi-list: 'Roboto',15px 1.3em; \/\/ This multi-list has two lists.\n```\n* **Maps** -  Sass maps are like associative arrays. A map stores both keys and values associated with those keys.\n\n```css\n$styling: (\n  'font-family': 'Lato',\n  'font-size': 1.5em,\n  'color': tomato,\n  'background': black\n);\n\nh1 {\n  color: map-get($styling, 'color');\n  background: map-get($styling, 'background');\n}\n```\n\n\n#### Explain CSS sprites, and how you would implement them on a page or site. \n*CSS sprites* combine multiple images into one single larger image. It is commonly used technique for icons (Gmail uses it). \n\n* Use a sprite generator that packs multiple images into one and generate the appropriate CSS for it.\n* Each image would have a corresponding CSS class with `background-image`, `background-position` and `background-size` properties defined.\n* To use that image, add the corresponding class to your element.\n\n**Advantages**:\n\n* Reduce the number of HTTP requests for multiple images (only one single request is required per spritesheet). But with HTTP2, loading multiple images is no longer much of an issue.\n* Advance downloading of assets that won\u2019t be downloaded until needed, such as images that only appear upon `:hover` pseudo-states. Blinking wouldn't be seen.\n\n\n#### What Selector Nesting in Sass is used for? \nSass *let you nest* your CSS selectors in a way that follows the same visual hierarchy of your HTML.  CSS, on the other hand, doesn't have any visual hierarchy.\n\nConsider example (scss):\n```css\n.parent {\n  color: red;\n\n  .child {\n    color: blue;\n  }\n}\n```\nResult (css):\n```css\n.parent {\n  color: red;\n}\n\n.parent .child {\n  color: blue;\n}\n```\n\n\n\n#### Explain what is a @extend directive used for in Sass? \nUsing `@extend` lets you share a set of CSS properties from one selector to another. It helps keep your Sass very dry.\n\nConsider:\n```css\n%message-shared {\n  border: 1px solid #ccc;\n  padding: 10px;\n  color: #333;\n}\n\n.message {\n  @extend %message-shared;\n}\n\n.success {\n  @extend %message-shared;\n  border-color: green;\n}\n\n.error {\n  @extend %message-shared;\n  border-color: red;\n}\n\n.warning {\n  @extend %message-shared;\n  border-color: yellow;\n}\n```\nCSS output:\n```css\n.message, .success, .error, .warning {\n  border: 1px solid #cccccc;\n  padding: 10px;\n  color: #333;\n}\n\n.success {\n  border-color: green;\n}\n\n.error {\n  border-color: red;\n}\n\n.warning {\n  border-color: yellow;\n}\n```\n\n\n\n\n#### Explain the CSS \u201cbox model\u201d and the layout components that it consists of \nThe CSS box model is a rectangular layout paradigm for HTML elements that consists of the following:\n\n* **Content** - The content of the box, where text and images appear\n* **Padding** - A transparent area surrounding the content (i.e., the amount of space between the border and the content)\n* **Border** - A border surrounding the padding (if any) and content\n* **Margin** - A transparent area surrounding the border (i.e., the amount of space between the border and any neighboring elements)\n\n\n#### What is the difference between classes and IDs in CSS? \n* **IDs**\u200a\u2014\u200aMeant to be unique within the document. Can be used to identify an element when linking using a fragment identifier. Elements can only have one id attribute.\n\n* **Classes**\u200a\u2014\u200aCan be reused on multiple elements within the document. Mainly for styling and targeting elements.\n\n\n#### Describe floats and how they work \n*Float* is a CSS positioning property. Floated elements remain a part of the flow of the web page. This is distinctly different than page elements that use absolute positioning. Absolutely positioned page elements are removed from the flow of the webpage.\n\n```css\n#sidebar {\n  float: right; \/\/ left right none inherit          \n}\n```\nThe CSS clear property can be used to be positioned below `left`\/`right`\/`both` floated elements.\n\n\n## [[\u2b06]](#toc) Career Interview Questions\n## [[\u2b06]](#toc) Clojure Interview Questions\n## [[\u2b06]](#toc) Code Problems Interview Questions\n#### Test divisors of three \n**Details:**\nYou will be given 2 parameters: a low and high number. Your goal is to print all numbers between low and high, and for each of these numbers print whether or not the number is divisible by 3. If the number is divisible by 3, print the word \"div3\" directly after the number.\n\nWe'll solve this problem by first creating a loop that will print each number from low to high. Once we have the code for that written, we'll add a conditional that will check if the number is evenly divisible by 3 by using the mod operator.\n\n```js\nfunction test_divisors(low, high) {\n\n  \/\/ we'll store all numbers and strings within an array\n  \/\/ instead of printing directly to the console\n  var output = [];\n\n  for (var i = low; i <= high; i++) {\n\n    \/\/ simply store the current number in the output array\n    output.push(i);\n\n    \/\/ check if the current number is evenly divisible by 3\n    if (i % 3 === 0) { output.push('div3'); }\n\n  }\n\n  \/\/ return all numbers and strings\n  return output;\n\n}\n\ntest_divisors(2, 10);\n```\n\n\n#### Sum of Array Plus One \n**Details:**\nWrite a function that takes an array of integers and returns the sum of the integers after adding 1 to each.\n\n```js\n\/\/ ES5 method is nice and clean\nexports.es5 = function (array) {\n  return array.reduce(function (memo, num) {\n    return memo + num;\n  }, array.length);\n};\n\n\/\/ Without array.reduce method isn't much different\nexports.iterative = function (array) {\n  var result = array.length;\n\n  for (var i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {\n    result += array[i];\n  }\n\n  return result;\n};\n```\n\n\n#### String Rotation \n**Details:**\nFind out if a string is a rotation of another string. E.g. `ABCD` is a rotation of `BCDA` but not `ACBD`.\n\nFirst make sure `a` and `b` are of the same length. Then check to see if `b` is a substring of `a` concatenated with `a`:\n\n```js\nmodule.exports = function (a, b) {\n  return a.length === b.length && (a + a).indexOf(b) > -1;\n};\n```\n\n\n\n\n#### Oddball sum \n**Details:**\nWrite a function called `oddball_sum` which takes in a list of numbers and returns the sum of all the odd elements. Try to solve with and without `reduce` function.\n\nTo solve this challenge we'll simply loop through the array while maintaining a final count, and every time an odd number is encountered we'll add it to the count.\n\nWithout `reduce`:\n```js\nfunction oddball_sum(nums) {\n\n  \/\/ final count of all odd numbers added up\n  var final_count = 0;\n\n  \/\/ loop through entire list\n  for (var i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {\n\n    \/\/ we divide by 2, and if there is a remainder then\n    \/\/ the number must be odd so we add it to final_count\n    if (nums[i] % 2 === 1) {\n      final_count += nums[i]\n    }\n\n  }\n\n  return final_count;\n\n}\n\noddball_sum([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]); \n```\n\nWith `reduce`:\n\n```js\nfunction oddball_sum(nums) {\n  return nums.reduce(function(total, item){\n    if (item % 2 === 1) {\n        return total += item;\n    }\n    return total;\n  });\n}\n```\n\n\n#### Simple clock angle \n**Details:**\nYou will be given a number `N` that represents where the minute hand currently is on a clock. Your program should return the angle that is formed by the minute hand and the `12` o'clock mark on the clock.\n\nIf the input is `15` then your program should return `90` because a `90`-degree angle is formed by the minute hand and the `12` o'clock mark on the clock. We'll solve this challenge by first calculating what angle is created by each minute passing on a clock. Once we calculate this number, we multiply it by the input to determine the final angle. \n\nA method to solve such problems is to consider the rate of change of the angle in degrees per minute. The hour hand of a normal `12-hour` analogue clock turns `360\u00b0` in `12` hours (`720` minutes) or `0.5\u00b0` per minute. The minute hand rotates through `360\u00b0` in `60` minutes or `6\u00b0` per minute.\n\n```js\nfunction simpleClockAngle(num) {\n\n  \/\/ we got 6 because 360\/60 = 6\n  \/\/ 360 represents the full number of a degrees in a circle and\n  \/\/ 60 is the number of minutes on a clock, so dividing these two numbers\n  \/\/ gives us the number of degrees for one minute\n  return 6 * num;\n\n}\n\nsimpleClockAngle(15);\n```\n\n\n\n\n#### Sum of several arrays \n**Details:**\nYou will be given an array of several arrays that each contain integers and your goal is to write a function that will sum up all the numbers in all the arrays. For example, if the input is `[[3, 2], [1], [4, 12]]` then your program should output `22` because `3 + 2 + 1 + 4 + 12 = 22`. Solve without and with `reduce`.\n\nWe will solve this challenge by looping through the entire array, and then looping through each inner array adding up all the numbers.\n\n```js\nfunction sum_array(arr) {\n  \/\/ store our final answer\n  var sum = 0;\n  \/\/ loop through entire array\n  for (var i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {\n    \/\/ loop through each inner array\n    for (var j = 0; j < arr[i].length; j++) {\n      \/\/ add this number to the current final sum\n      sum += arr[i][j];\n    }\n  }\n\n  return sum;\n}\n\nsum_array([[3, 2], [1], [4, 12]]);\n```\n\nWith `reduce`:\n\n```js\nfunction sumArray(arr) {\n  return arr.reduce((t, e) => t.concat(e)).reduce((t, e) => t + e)\n}\n```\n\n\n#### Lucky sevens \n**Details:**\nWrite a function called `lucky_sevens` which takes an array of integers and returns true if any three consecutive elements sum to 7.\n\nTo solve this challenge we'll simply loop through the array starting at the 3rd position, and checking if the number at this index plus the two previous elements sums to 7. We continue doing this as we loop through the entire array. Once we find three elements that sum to 7, we simply return `true`. If we reach the end of the array without finding elements that sum to 7, we return `false`.\n\n```js\nfunction lucky_sevens(arr) {\n\n  \/\/ if less than 3 elements then this challenge is not possible\n  if (arr.length < 3) {\n    return \"not possible\";\n  }\n\n  \/\/ because we know there are at least 3 elements we can\n  \/\/ start the loop at the 3rd element in the array (i=2)\n  \/\/ and check it along with the two previous elements (i-1) and (i-2)\n  for (var i = 2; i < arr.length; i++) {\n    if (arr[i] + arr[i-1] + arr[i-2] === 7) {\n      return true; \n    }\n  }\n\n  \/\/ if loop is finished and no elements summed to 7\n  return false;\n\n}\n\nlucky_sevens([2, 1, 5, 1, 0]);\n``` \n\n\n\n\n#### Two sum problem \n**Details:**\nGiven an integer `x` and a sorted array a of `N` distinct integers, design a linear-time algorithm to determine if there exists two distinct indices `i` and `j` such that `a[i] + a[j] == x`\n\nFor example, if the array is `[3, 5, 2, -4, 8, 11]` and the sum is `7`, \nyour program should return `[[11, -4], [2, 5]]` because `11 + -4 = 7` and `2 + 5 = 7`.\n\nThe algorithm below makes use of hash tables which have a constant lookup time. As we pass through each element in the array, we check to see if S minus the current element exists in the hash table. We only need to loop through the array once, resulting in a running time of `O(n)` since each lookup and insertion in a hash table is `O(1)`.\n\n```js\n\/\/ our two sum function which will return\n\/\/ all pairs in the array that sum up to S\nfunction twoSum(arr, S) {\n\n  var sums = [];\n  var hashTable = {};\n\n  \/\/ check each element in array\n  for (var i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {\n\n    \/\/ calculate S - current element\n    var sumMinusElement = S - arr[i];\n\n    \/\/ check if this number exists in hash table\n    \/\/ if so then we found a pair of numbers that sum to S\n    if (hashTable[sumMinusElement.toString()] !== undefined) { \n      sums.push([arr[i], sumMinusElement]);\n    }\n\n    \/\/ add the current number to the hash table\n    hashTable[arr[i].toString()] = arr[i];\n\n  }\n\n  \/\/ return all pairs of integers that sum to S\n  return sums;\n\n}\n\ntwoSum([3, 5, 2, -4, 8, 11], 7);\n```\n\n\n\n\n#### Implement a queue using a linked list \nWe will store a reference to the front and back of the queue in order to make enqueuing and dequeuing run in `O(1)` constant time. Every time we want to insert into the queue, we add the new element to the end of the linked list and update the back pointer. When we want to dequeue we return the first node in the linked list and update the front pointer.\n\n```js\n\/\/ queue is initially empty\nvar Queue = {front: null, back: null};\n\n\/\/ we will use a node to keep track of the elements\n\/\/ in the queue which is represented by a linked list\nfunction Node(data, next) {\n  this.data = data;\n  this.next = next;\n} \n\n\/\/ add elements to queue in O(1) time\nfunction Enqueue(element) {\n  var N = new Node(element, null);\n  if (Queue.back === null) {\n    Queue.front = N;\n    Queue.back = N; \n  } else { \n    Queue.back.next = N; \n    Queue.back = Queue.back.next;\n  } \n}\n\n\/\/ remove first element from queue in O(1) time\nfunction Dequeue() {\n  if (Queue.front !== null) { \n    var first = Queue.front;\n    Queue.front = Queue.front.next; \n    return first.data;\n  } else {\n    if (Queue.back !== null) { Queue.back = null; }\n    return 'Cannot dequeue because queue is empty';\n  }\n}\n\nEnqueue('a'); \nEnqueue('b'); \nEnqueue('c'); \nDequeue();\n```\n\n\n#### Tree Level Order Print \n**Details:**\nGiven a binary tree of integers, print it in level order. The output will contain space between the numbers in the same level, and new line between different levels.\n\n```js\nmodule.exports = function (root) {\n  \/\/ Doing a breadth first search using recursion.\n  (function walkLevel (children) {\n    \/\/ Create a new queue for the next level.\n    var queue = [],\n        output;\n\n    \/\/ Use the map function to easily join all the nodes together while pushing\n    \/\/ it's children into the next level queue.\n    output = children.map(function (node) {\n      \/\/ Assuming the node has children stored in an array.\n      queue = queue.concat(node.children || []);\n      return node.value;\n    }).join(' ');\n\n    \/\/ Log the output at each level.\n    console.log(output);\n\n    \/\/ If the queue has values in it, recurse to the next level and walk\n    \/\/ along it.\n    queue.length && walkLevel(queue);\n  })([root]);\n};\n```\n\n\n\n#### Stock maximum profit \n**Details:**\nYou will be given a list of stock prices for a given day and your goal is to return the maximum profit that could have been made by buying a stock at the given price and then selling the stock later on. \n\nFor example if the input is: \n\n```js\n[45, 24, 35, 31, 40, 38, 11] \n```\n\nthen your program should return 16 because if you bought the stock at $24 and sold it at $40, a profit of $16 was made and this is the largest profit that could be made. If no profit could have been made, return -1.\n\nWe'll solve the challenge the following way:\n\n1. Iterate through each number in the list.\n2. At the ith index, get the `i+1` index price and check if it is larger than the ith index price.\n3. If so, set `buy_price = i` and `sell_price = i+1`. Then calculate the profit: `sell_price - buy_price`.\n4. If a stock price is found that is cheaper than the current `buy_price`, set this to be the new buying price and continue from step 2.\n5. Otherwise, continue changing only the `sell_price` and keep `buy_price` set.\n\nThis algorithm runs in linear time, making only one pass through the array, so the running time in the worst case is `O(n)`.\n\n```js\nfunction StockPicker(arr) { \n\n  var max_profit = -1;\n  var buy_price = 0;\n  var sell_price = 0;\n\n  \/\/ this allows our loop to keep iterating the buying\n  \/\/ price until a cheap stock price is found\n  var change_buy_index = true;\n\n  \/\/ loop through list of stock prices once\n  for (var i = 0; i < arr.length-1; i++) {\n\n    \/\/ selling price is the next element in list\n    sell_price = arr[i+1]; \n\n    \/\/ if we have not found a suitable cheap buying price yet\n    \/\/ we set the buying price equal to the current element\n    if (change_buy_index) { buy_price = arr[i]; }\n\n    \/\/ if the selling price is less than the buying price\n    \/\/ we know we cannot make a profit so we continue to the \n    \/\/ next element in the list which will be the new buying price\n    if (sell_price < buy_price) {\n      change_buy_index = true; \n      continue;\n    }\n\n    \/\/ if the selling price is greater than the buying price\n    \/\/ we check to see if these two indices give us a better \n    \/\/ profit then what we currently have\n    else { \n      var temp_profit = sell_price - buy_price;\n      if (temp_profit > max_profit) { max_profit = temp_profit; }\n      change_buy_index = false;\n    }\n\n  }\n\n  return max_profit;\n\n}\n\nStockPicker([44, 30, 24, 32, 35, 30, 40, 38, 15]);  \n```\n\n\n#### Find Word Positions in Text \n**Details:**\nGiven a text file and a word, find the positions that the word occurs in the file. We\u2019ll be asked to find the positions of many words in the same file.\n\nSince we\u2019ll have to answer multiple queries, precomputation would be useful. We\u2019ll build a data structure that stores the positions of all the words in the text file. This is known as inverted index.\n\n```js\nmodule.exports = function (text) {\n  var trie   = {},\n      pos    = 0,\n      active = trie; \/\/ Start the active structure as the root trie structure\n\n  \/\/ Suffix a space after the text to make life easier\n  text += ' ';\n\n  \/\/ Loop through the input text adding it to the trie structure\n  for (var i = 0; i < text.length; i++) {\n    \/\/ When the character is a space, restart\n    if (text[i] === ' ') {\n      \/\/ If the current active doesn't equal the root, set the position\n      if (active !== trie) {\n        (active.positions = active.positions || []).push(pos);\n      }\n      \/\/ Reset the positions and the active part of the data structure\n      pos    = i;\n      active = trie;\n      continue;\n    }\n\n    \/\/ Set the next character in the structure up\n    active[text[i]] = (active[text[i]] || {});\n    active = active[text[i]];\n  }\n\n  \/\/ Return a function that accepts a word and looks it up in the trie structure\n  return function (word) {\n    var i      = -1,\n        active = trie;\n\n    while (word[++i]) {\n      if (!active[word[i]]) { return []; }\n      active = active[word[i]];\n    }\n\n    return active.positions;\n  };\n};\n```\n\n\n#### Determine overlapping numbers in ranges \n**Details:**\nYou will be given an array with `5` numbers. The first 2 numbers represent a range, and the next two numbers represent another range. The final number in the array is `X`. The goal of your program is to determine if both ranges overlap by at least `X` numbers. For example, in the array `[4, 10, 2, 6, 3]` the ranges `4` to `10` and `2` to `6` overlap by at least `3` numbers `(4, 5, 6)`, so your program should return `true`. Solve with and without looping.\n\nIf the array is `[10, 20, 4, 14, 4]` then the ranges are:\n\n```sh\n10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20\n4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14\n```\n\nThese ranges overlap by at least `4` numbers, namely: `10, 11, 12, 13, 14` so your program should return `true`.\n\nWith loop:\n```js\nfunction OverlappingRanges(arr) {\n\n  \/\/ keep a count of how many numbers overlap\n  var counter = 0;\n\n  \/\/ loop through one of the ranges\n  for (var i = arr[0]; i < arr[1]; i++) {\n\n    \/\/ check if a number within the first range exists\n    \/\/ in the second range\n    if (i >= arr[2] && i <= arr[3]) { \n      counter += 1;\n    }\n\n  }\n\n  \/\/ check if the numbers that overlap is equal to or greater\n  \/\/ than the last number in the array\n  return (counter >= arr[4]) ? true : false;\n}\n\nOverlappingRanges([4, 10, 2, 6, 3]); \n```\n\nWithout loop:\n\n```js\nfunction overlapping(input){\n  var nums1 = listOfNums(input[0], input[1]);\n  var nums2 = listOfNums(input[2], input[3]);\n  var overlappingNum = 0;\n\n  if(nums1[0] >= nums2[0] && nums1[0] <= nums2[1]){\n    overlappingNum =  nums2[1] - nums1[0] + 1;\n  } else {\n    overlappingNum =  nums1[1] - nums2[0] + 1;\n  }\n  if(overlappingNum >= input[4]){\n    return true;\n  }\n}\n\nfunction listOfNums(a, b){\n  var start = a;\n  var end = b;\n  if(a > b){\n    start = b;\n    end = a;\n  }\n\n  return [a, b];\n}\n\nvar a = [4, 10, 2, 6, 3];\noverlapping(a)\n```\n\n\n\n#### Throttle Function Implementation \n**Details:**\nWrite a function that accepts a function and timeout, `x`, in number of milliseconds. It returns a function that can only be executed once per `x` milliseconds. This can be useful for limiting the number of time and computation heavy function that are run. For example, making AJAX requests to an autocompletion API.\n\nOnce written, add a third parameter that will allow the function to be executed immediately if set to true. Otherwise the function will run at the end of the timeout period.\n\n```js\nmodule.exports = function (fn, delay, execAsap) {\n  var timeout; \/\/ Keeps a reference to the timeout inside the returned function\n\n  return function () {\n    \/\/ Continue to pass through the function execution context and arguments\n    var that = this,\n        args = arguments;\n\n    \/\/ If there is no timeout variable set, proceed to create a new timeout\n    if (!timeout) {\n      execAsap && fn.apply(that, args);\n\n      timeout = setTimeout(function () {\n        execAsap || fn.apply(that, args);\n        \/\/ Remove the old timeout variable so the function can run again\n        timeout = null;\n      }, delay || 100);\n    }\n  };\n};\n```\n\n\n\n#### Dutch national flag sorting problem \n**Details:**\nFor this problem, your goal is to sort an array of `0`, `1`, `2` but you must do this in place, in linear time and without any extra space (such as creating an extra array). This is called the *Dutch national flag sorting problem*. For example, if the input array is `[2,0,0,1,2,1]` then your program should output `[0,0,1,1,2,2]` and the algorithm should run in `O(n)` time.\n\nThe solution to this algorithm will require 3 pointers to iterate throughout the array, swapping the necessary elements.\n\n1. Create a low pointer at the beginning of the array and a high pointer at the end of the array.\n2. Create a mid pointer that starts at the beginning of the array and iterates through each element.\n3. If the element at `arr[mid]` is a `2`, then swap `arr[mid]` and `arr[high]` and decrease the high pointer by `1`.\n4. If the element at `arr[mid]` is a `0`, then swap `arr[mid]` and `arr[low]` and increase the low and mid pointers by `1`.\n5. If the element at `arr[mid]` is a `1`, don't swap anything and just increase the mid pointer by `1`.\n\n```js\nfunction swap(arr, i1, i2) {\n  var temp = arr[i1];\n  arr[i1] = arr[i2];\n  arr[i2] = temp;\n}\n\nfunction dutchNatFlag(arr) {\n\n  var low = 0;\n  var mid = 0;\n  var high = arr.length - 1;\n\n  \/\/ one pass through the array swapping\n  \/\/ the necessary elements in place\n  while (mid <= high) {\n    if      (arr[mid] === 0) { swap(arr, low++, mid++); }\n    else if (arr[mid] === 2) { swap(arr, mid, high--); }\n    else if (arr[mid] === 1) { mid++; }\n  }\n\n  return arr;\n\n}\n\ndutchNatFlag([2,2,2,0,0,0,1,1]); \n```\n\n\n#### Step-by-step solution for step counting using recursion \n**Details:**\n\nSuppose you want climb a staircase of N steps, and on each step you can take either 1 or 2 steps. How many distinct ways are there to climb the staircase? For example, if you wanted to climb 4 steps, you can take the following distinct number of steps:\n\n```sh\n1) 1, 1, 1, 1\n2) 1, 1, 2\n3) 1, 2, 1\n4) 2, 1, 1\n5) 2, 2\n```\n\nSo there are 5 distinct ways to climb 4 steps. We want to write a function, using recursion, that will produce the answer for any number of steps. \n\n\nThe solution to this problem requires recursion, which means to solve for a particular `N`, we need the solutions for previous N's. The solution for N steps is equal to the solutions for `N - 1` steps plus `N - 2` steps.\n\n```js\nfunction countSteps(N) {\n\n  \/\/ just as in our solution explanation above, we know that to climb 1 step\n  \/\/ there is only 1 solution, and for 2 steps there are 2 solutions\n  if (N === 1) { return 1; }\n  if (N === 2) { return 2; }\n\n  \/\/ for all N > 2, we add the previous (N - 1) + (N - 2) steps to get\n  \/\/ an answer recursively\n  return countSteps(N - 1) + countSteps(N - 2);\n\n}\n\n\/\/ the solution for N = 6 will recursively be solved by calculating\n\/\/ the solution for N = 5, N = 4, N = 3, and N = 2 which we know is 2\ncountSteps(6); \n```\n\n\n\n#### Implement Bubble Sort \nThe steps in the bubble sort algorithm are:\n\n1. Loop through the whole array starting from index `1`\n2. If the number in the array at index `i-1` is greater than i, swap the numbers and continue\n3. Once the end of the array is reached, start looping again from the beginning\n4. Once no more elements can be swapped, the sorting is complete\n\n```js\nfunction swap(arr, i1, i2) {\n  var temp = arr[i1];\n  arr[i1] = arr[i2];\n  arr[i2] = temp;\n}\n\nfunction bubblesort(arr) {\n\n  var swapped = true;\n\n  \/\/ keep going unless no elements can be swapped anymore\n  while (swapped) {\n\n    \/\/ set swapped to false so that the loop stops\n    \/\/ unless two element are actually swapped\n    swapped = false;\n\n    \/\/ loop through the whole array swapping adjacent elements\n    for (var i = 1; i < arr.length; i++) {\n      if (arr[i-1] > arr[i]) {\n        swap(arr, i-1, i);\n        swapped = true;\n      }\n    }\n\n  }\n\n  return arr;\n\n}\n\nbubblesort([103, 45, 2, 1, 97, -4, 67]); \n```\n\n\n#### Implement a queue using two stacks \nSuppose we push `a`, `b`, `c` to a stack. If we are trying to implement a queue and we call the dequeue method 3 times, we actually want the elements to come out in the order: `a`, `b`, `c`, which is in the opposite order they would come out if we popped from the stack. So, basically, we need to access the elements in the reverse order that they exist in the stack. \n\n*Algorithm* for queue using two stacks:\n\n1. When calling the enqueue method, simply push the elements into the stack 1.\n2. If the dequeue method is called, push all the elements from stack 1 into stack 2, which reverses the order of the elements. Now pop from stack 2.\n\nThe worst case running time for implementing these operations using stacks is `O(n)` because you need to transfer n elements from stack 1 to stack 2 when a dequeue method is called. Pushing to stack 1 is simply `O(1)`.\n\n```js\n\/\/ implement stacks using plain arrays with push and pop functions\nvar Stack1 = [];\nvar Stack2 = [];\n\n\/\/ implement enqueue method by using only stacks\n\/\/ and the push and pop functions\nfunction Enqueue(element) {\n  Stack1.push(element);\n}\n\n\/\/ implement dequeue method by pushing all elements\n\/\/ from stack 1 into stack 2, which reverses the order\n\/\/ and then popping from stack 2\nfunction Dequeue() {\n  if (Stack2.length === 0) {\n    if (Stack1.length === 0) { return 'Cannot dequeue because queue is empty'; }\n    while (Stack1.length > 0) {\n      var p = Stack1.pop();\n      Stack2.push(p);\n    }\n  }\n  return Stack2.pop();\n}\n\nEnqueue('a');\nEnqueue('b');\nEnqueue('c');\nDequeue(); \n```\n\n\n## [[\u2b06]](#toc) Data Science Interview Questions\n#### What is Data Science? \nData Science is an interdisciplinary field of different scientific methods, techniques, processes, and knowledge that is used to transform the data of different types such as structured, unstructured and semi-structured data into the required format or representation.\n\nData Science concepts include different concepts such as statistics, regression, mathematics, computer science, algorithms, data structures and information science with also including some subfields such as data mining, machine learning, and databases etc.,\n\nData Science concept has recently evolved to a greater extent in the area of computing technology in order to perform data analysis on the existing data where the growth of data is in terms of an exponential with respect to time.\n\nData Science is the study of various types of data such as structured, semi-structured and unstructured data in any form or formats available in order to get some information out of it.\n\nData Science consists of different technologies used to study data such as data mining, data storing, data purging, data archival, data transformation etc., in order to make it efficient and ordered. Data Science also includes the concepts like Simulation, modeling, analytics, machine learning, computational mathematics etc.\n\n\n#### What is the best Programming Language to use in Data Science? \nData Science can be handled by using programming languages like Python or R programming language. These two are the two most popular languages being used by the Data Scientists or Data Analysts. R and Python are open source and are free to use and came into existence during the 1990s.\n\nPython and R have different advantages depending on the applications and required a business goal. Python is better to be used in the cases of repeated tasks or jobs and for data manipulations whereas R programming can be used for querying or retrieving datasets and customized data analysis.\n\nMostly Python is preferred for all types of data science applications where some time R programming is preferred in the cases of high or complex data applications. Python is easier to learn and has less learning curve whereas R has a deep learning curve.\n\nPython is mostly preferred in all the cases which is a general-purpose programming language and can be found in many applications other than Data Science too. R is mostly seen in Data Science area only where it is used for data analysis in standalone servers or computing separately.\n\n\n#### Why is data cleaning essential in Data Science? \nData cleaning is more important in Data Science because the end results or the outcomes of the data analysis come from the existing data where useless or unimportant need to be cleaned periodically as of when not required. This ensures the data reliability & accuracy and also memory is freed up.\n\nData cleaning reduces the data redundancy and gives good results in data analysis where some large customer information exists and that should be cleaned periodically. In the businesses like e-commerce, retail, government organizations contain large customer transaction information which is outdated and needs to be cleaned.\n\nDepending on the amount or size of data, suitable tools or methods should be used to clean the data from the database or big data environment. There are different types of data existing in a data source such as dirty data, clean data, mixed clean and dirty data and sample clean data.\n\nModern data science applications rely on machine learning model where the learner learns from the existing data. So, the existing data should always be cleanly and well maintained to get sophisticated and good outcomes during the optimization of the system.\n\n\n#### What is Linear Regression in Data Science? \nLinear Regression is a technique used in supervised machine learning algorithmic process in the area of Data Science. This method is used for predictive analysis.\n\nPredictive analytics is an area within Statistical Sciences where the existing information will be extracted and processed to predict the trends and outcomes pattern. The core of the subject lies in the analysis of existing context to predict an unknown event.\n\nThe process of Linear Regression method is to predict a variable called target variable by making the best relationship between the dependent variable and an independent variable. Here dependent variable is outcome variable and also response variable whereas the independent variable is predictor variable or explanatory variable.\n\nFor example in real life, depending on the expenses occurred in this financial year or monthly expenses, the predictions happen by calculating the approximate upcoming months or financial years expenses.\n\nIn this method, the implementation can be done by using Python programming technique where this is the most important method used in Machine Learning technique under the area of Data Science.\n\nLinear regression is also called Regression analysis that comes under the area of Statistical Sciences which is integrated together with Data Science.\n\n\n#### What is A\/B testing in Data Science? \nA\/B testing is also called as Bucket Testing or Split Testing. This is the method of comparing and testing two versions of systems or applications against each other to determine which version of application performs better. This is important in the cases where multiple versions are shown to the customers or end users in order to achieve the goals.\n\nIn the area of Data Science, this A\/B testing is used to know which variable out of the existing two variables in order to optimize or increase the outcome of the goal. A\/B testing is also called Design of Experiment. This testing helps in establishing a cause and effect relationship between the independent and dependent variables.\n\nThis testing is also simply a combination of design experimentation or statistical inference. Significance, Randomization and Multiple Comparisons are the key elements of the A\/B testing.\n\nThe significance is the term for the significance of statistical tests conducted. Randomization is the core component of the experimental design where the variables will be balanced. Multiple comparisons are the way of comparing more variables in the case of customer interests that causes more false positives resulting in the requirement of correction in the confidence level of a seller in the area of e-commerce.\n\nA\/B testing is the important one in the area of Data Science in predicting the outcomes.\n\n\n## [[\u2b06]](#toc) Data Structures Interview Questions\n#### What is data-structure? \nData structure availability may vary by programming languages. Commonly available data structures are:\n* list, \n* arrays, \n* stack, \n* queues, \n* graph, \n* tree etc.\n\n\n#### What is a graph? \nA **graph** is a pictorial representation of a set of objects where some pairs of objects are connected by links. The interconnected objects are represented by points termed as vertices, and the links that connect the vertices are called edges.\n\n\n#### What is linear searching? \n**Linear search** or sequential search is a method for finding a target value within a list. It sequentially checks each element of the list for the target value until a match is found or until all the elements have been searched. Linear search runs in at worst *linear time* and makes at most `n` comparisons, where `n` is the length of the list. \n\n* Worst-case performance    `O(n)`\n* Best-case performance `O(1)`\n* Average performance   `O(n)`\n* Worst-case space complexity   `O(1)` iterative\n\nIn theory other search algorithms may be faster than linear search (for instance binary search), in practice even on medium-sized arrays (around 100 items or less) it might be infeasible to use anything else. \n\n\n#### What is algorithm? \n**Algorithm** is a step by step procedure, which defines a set of instructions to be executed in certain order to get the desired output.\n\n\n#### What is linear data structure and what are common operations to perform on it? \nA *linear data-structure* has sequentially arranged data items. The next item can be located in the next memory address. It is stored and accessed in a sequential manner. **Array** and **list** are example of linear data structure.\n\nThe following operations are commonly performed on any data-structure:\n\n*   **Insertion** \u2212 adding a data item\n*   **Deletion** \u2212 removing a data item\n*   **Traversal** \u2212 accessing and\/or printing all data items\n*   **Searching** \u2212 finding a particular data item\n*   **Sorting** \u2212 arranging data items in a pre-defined sequence\n\n\n#### What is an average case complexity of Bubble Sort? \n**Bubble sort**, sometimes referred to as sinking sort, is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list to be sorted, compares each pair of adjacent items and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. The pass through the list is repeated until no swaps are needed, which indicates that the list is sorted. \n\nBubble sort has a worst-case and average complexity of `\u041e(n2)`, where `n` is the number of items being sorted. Most practical sorting algorithms have substantially better worst-case or average complexity, often `O(n log n)`. Therefore, bubble sort is not a practical sorting algorithm.\n\n\n\n\n#### What examples of greedy algorithms do you know? \nThe below given problems find their solution using greedy algorithm approach:\n\n*   Travelling Salesman Problem\n*   Prim's Minimal Spanning Tree Algorithm\n*   Kruskal's Minimal Spanning Tree Algorithm\n*   Dijkstra's Minimal Spanning Tree Algorithm\n*   Graph - Map Coloring\n*   Graph - Vertex Cover\n*   Knapsack Problem\n*   Job Scheduling Problem\n\n\n#### What are some examples of divide and conquer algorithms? \nThe below given problems find their solution using divide and conquer algorithm approach:\n\n*   Merge Sort\n*   Quick Sort\n*   Binary Search\n*   Strassen's Matrix Multiplication\n*   Closest pair (points)\n\n\n#### What are some examples of dynamic programming algorithms? \nThe below given problems find their solution using divide and conquer algorithm approach:\n\n*   Fibonacci number series\n*   Knapsack problem\n*   Tower of Hanoi\n*   All pair shortest path by Floyd-Warshall\n*   Shortest path by Dijkstra\n*   Project scheduling\n\n\n#### Why do we use stacks? \nIn data-structure, **stack** is an Abstract Data Type (ADT) used to store and retrieve values in Last In First Out (LIFO) method.\n\nStacks follows LIFO method and addition and retrieval of a data item takes only `\u039f(n)` time. Stacks are used where we need to access data in the reverse order or their arrival. Stacks are used commonly in recursive function calls, expression parsing, depth first traversal of graphs etc.\n\nThe below operations can be performed on a stack:\n\n*   **push()** \u2212 adds an item to stack\n*   **pop()** \u2212 removes the top stack item\n*   **peek()** \u2212 gives value of top item without removing it\n*   **isempty()** \u2212 checks if stack is empty\n*   **isfull()** \u2212 checks if stack is full\n\n\n#### Why do we use queues? \n**Queue** is an abstract data structure (ADS), somewhat similar to stack. In contrast to stack, queue is opened at both end. One end is always used to insert data (enqueue) and the other is used to remove data (dequeue). Queue follows First-In-First-Out (FIFO) methodology, i.e., the data item stored first will be accessed first.\n\nAs queues follows FIFO method, they are used when we need to work on data-items in exact sequence of their arrival. Every operating system maintains queues of various processes. Priority queues and breadth first traversal of graphs are some examples of queues.\n\nThe below operations can be performed on a queue:\n*   **enqueue()** \u2212 adds an item to rear of the queue\n*   **dequeue()** \u2212 removes the item from front of the queue\n*   **peek()** \u2212 gives value of front item without removing it\n*   **isempty()** \u2212 checks if stack is empty\n*   **isfull()** \u2212 checks if stack is full\n\n\n#### What is Selection Sort? \n**Selection sort** is in-place sorting technique. It divides the data set into two sub-lists: sorted and unsorted. Then it selects the minimum element from unsorted sub-list and places it into the sorted list. This iterates unless all the elements from unsorted sub-list are consumed into sorted sub-list.\n\n\n#### Why we need to do algorithm analysis? \nA problem can be solved in more than one ways. So, many solution algorithms can be derived for a given problem. We analyze available algorithms to find and implement the best suitable algorithm.\n\nAn algorithm are generally analyzed on two factors \u2212 time and space. That is, how much **execution** time and how much **extra space** required by the algorithm.\n\n\n#### What is the difference between Linear Search and Binary Search? \n* A **linear search** looks down a list, one item at a time, without jumping. In complexity terms this is an `O(n)` search - the time taken to search the list gets bigger at the same rate as the list does.\n\n* A **binary search** is when you start with the middle of a sorted list, and see whether that's greater than or less than the value you're looking for, which determines whether the value is in the first or second half of the list. Jump to the half way through the sublist, and compare again etc. In complexity terms this is an `O(log n)` search - the number of search operations grows more slowly than the list does, because you're halving the \"search space\" with each operation.\n\nComparing the two:\n\n- Binary search requires the input data to be sorted; linear search doesn't\n- Binary search requires an *ordering* comparison; linear search only requires equality comparisons\n- Binary search has complexity `O(log n)`; linear search has complexity O(n)\n- Binary search requires random access to the data; linear search only requires sequential access (this can be very important - it means a linear search can *stream* data of arbitrary size)\n\n\n#### What is asymptotic analysis of an algorithm? \n**Asymptotic analysis** of an algorithm, refers to defining the mathematical boundation\/framing of its run-time performance. Using asymptotic analysis, we can very well conclude the best case, average case and worst case scenario of an algorithm.\n\nAsymptotic analysis can provide three levels of mathematical binding of execution time of an algorithm:\n\n*   Best case is represented by \u03a9(n) notation.\n*   Worst case is represented by \u039f(n) notation.\n*   Average case is represented by \u0398(n) notation.\n\n\n## [[\u2b06]](#toc) Design Patterns Interview Questions\n#### What are the main categories of Design Patterns? \nThe Design patterns can be classified into three main categories:\n\n* Creational Patterns\n* Behavioral Patterns\n* Functional Patterns\n\n\n#### What is a pattern? \n*Patterns* in programming are like recipes in cooking. They are not ready dishes, but instructions for slicing and dicing products, cooking them, serving them and so forth.\n\n**Pattern content**\nAs a rule, a pattern description consists of the following:\n\n* a problem that the pattern solves;\n* motivation for solving the the problem using the method suggested by the pattern;\n* structures of classes comprising the solution;\n* an example in one of the programming languages;\n* a description of the nuances of pattern implementation in various contexts;\nrelations with other patterns.\n\n\n#### What is Singleton pattern? \n**Singleton pattern** comes under *creational* patterns category and introduces a single class which is responsible to create an object while making sure that only single object gets created. This class provides a way to access its only object which can be accessed directly without need to instantiate the object of the class.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n#### What is Design Patterns and why anyone should use them? \nDesign patterns are a well-described solution to the most commonly encountered problems which occur during software development. \n\nDesign pattern represents the best practices evolved over a period of time by experienced software developers. They promote reusability which leads to a more robust and maintainable code.\n\n\n#### What is Factory pattern? \n**Factory pattern** is one of most used design pattern and comes under *creational* patterns category.\n\nIn Factory pattern, we create object without exposing the creation logic to the client and refer to newly created object using a *common interface*.\n\n\n\n\n\n**Pro's**:  \n\n*   Allows you to hide implementation of an application seam (the core interfaces that make up your application)\n*   Allows you to easily test the seam of an application (that is to mock\/stub) certain parts of your application so you can build and test the other parts\n*   Allows you to change the design of your application more readily, this is known as loose coupling\n\n**Con's**  \n\n*   Makes code more difficult to read as all of your code is behind an abstraction that may in turn hide abstractions.\n*   Can be classed as an anti-pattern when it is incorrectly used, for example some people use it to wire up a whole application when using an IOC container, instead use Dependency Injection.\n\n\n#### What is Iterator pattern? \n**Iterator pattern** is very commonly used design pattern in Java and .Net programming environment. This pattern is used to get a way to access the elements of a collection object in sequential manner without any need to know its underlying representation. Iterator pattern falls under _behavioral_ pattern category.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n#### What is Inversion of Control? \n\n*Inversion of control* is a broad term but for a software developer it's most commonly described as a pattern used for decoupling components and layers in the system. \n\nFor example, say your application has a text editor component and you want to provide spell checking. Your standard code would look something like this:\n```js\npublic class TextEditor {\n\n    private SpellChecker checker;\n\n    public TextEditor() {\n        this.checker = new SpellChecker();\n    }\n}\n```\nWhat we've done here creates a dependency between the TextEditor and the SpellChecker. In an IoC scenario we would instead do something like this:\n```js\npublic class TextEditor {\n\n    private IocSpellChecker checker;\n\n    public TextEditor(IocSpellChecker checker) {\n        this.checker = checker;\n    }\n}\n```\n\nYou have *inverted control* by handing the responsibility of instantiating the spell checker from the TextEditor class to the caller.\n\n```js\nSpellChecker sc = new SpellChecker; \/\/ dependency\nTextEditor textEditor = new TextEditor(sc);\n```\n\n\n\n#### Can we create a clone of a singleton object? \nYesl, we can but the purpose of Singleton Object creation is to have single instance serving all requests. \n\n\n#### Name types of Design Patterns? \nDesign patterns can be classified in three categories: Creational, Structural and Behavioral patterns.\n\n-   Creational Patterns\u00a0- These design patterns provide a way to create objects while hiding the creation logic, rather than instantiating objects directly using new opreator. This gives program more flexibility in deciding which objects need to be created for a given use case.\n\n-   Structural Patterns\u00a0- These design patterns concern class and object composition. Concept of inheritance is used to compose interfaces and define ways to compose objects to obtain new functionalities.\n\n-   Behavioral Patterns\u00a0- These design patterns are specifically concerned with communication between objects.\n\n\n#### What is Template pattern? \nIn **Template pattern**, an abstract class exposes defined way(s)\/template(s) to execute its methods. Its subclasses can override the method implementation as per need but the invocation is to be in the same way as defined by an abstract class. This pattern comes under _behavior_ pattern category.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n#### What is Filter pattern? \n**Filter pattern** or **Criteria pattern** is a design pattern that enables developers to filter a set of objects using different criteria and chaining them in a decoupled way through logical operations. This type of design pattern comes under *structural* pattern as this pattern combines multiple criteria to obtain single criteria.\n\n**Filter design pattern** is useful where you want to add filters dynamically or you are implementing multiple functionalities and most of them require different filter criteria to filter something. In that case instead of hard coding the filters inside the functionalities, you can create filter criteria and re-use it wherever required.\n\n```js\nList laptops = LaptopFactory.manufactureInBulk();\nAndCriteria searchCriteria = new AndCriteria(\n  new HardDisk250GBFilter(), \n  new MacintoshFilter(), \n  new I5ProcessorFilter());\nList filteredLaptops = searchCriteria.meets(laptops);\n```\n\n\n#### What is Strategy pattern? \nIn **Strategy pattern**, a class behavior or its algorithm can be changed at run time. This type of design pattern comes under _behavior_ pattern.\n\nIn Strategy pattern, we create objects which represent various strategies and a context object whose behavior varies as per its strategy object. The strategy object changes the executing algorithm of the context object.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n#### What is Dependency Injection? \n*Dependency injection* makes it easy to create loosely coupled components, which typically means that components consume functionality defined by interfaces without having any first-hand knowledge of which implementation classes are being used.\n\n*Dependency injection* makes it easier to change the behavior of an application by changing the components that implement the interfaces that define application features. It also results in components that are easier to isolate for unit testing.\n\n\n#### What is Null Object pattern? \nIn **Null Object pattern**, a null object replaces check of NULL object instance. Instead of putting if check for a null value, Null Object reflects a do nothing relationship. Such Null object can also be used to provide default behaviour in case data is not available.\n\nIn Null Object pattern, we create an abstract class specifying various operations to be done, concrete classes extending this class and a null object class providing do nothing implementation of this class and will be used seamlessly where we need to check null value.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n#### What is State pattern? \nIn **State pattern** a class behavior changes based on its state. This type of design pattern comes under _behavior_ pattern. In State pattern, we create objects which represent various states and a context object whose behavior varies as its state object changes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n#### What is Proxy pattern? \nIn **proxy pattern**, a class represents functionality of another class. This type of design pattern comes under _structural_ pattern.\n\nIn proxy pattern, we create object having original object to interface its functionality to outer world.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n#### What is Builder pattern? \n*Builder pattern* builds a complex object using simple objects and using a step by step approach. This builder is independent of other objects.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Director class is optional and is used to make sure that the building steps are executed in the right order with the right data by the right builder. It's about validation and delegation.Builder\/Director pattern's steps invocations could be semantically presented by method chaining or so called Fluent Interface syntax. js\nPizza pizza = new Pizza.Builder()\n                       .cheese(true)\n                       .pepperoni(true)\n                       .bacon(true)\n                       .build();[\u2b06] DevOps Interview Questions"},{"question":"explain what is DevOps ?","answer":"DevOps is a newly emerging term in IT field, which is nothing but a practice that emphasizes the collaboration and communication of both software developers and other information-technology (IT) professionals.

On the other hand, an abstract class may contain both abstract and non-abstract methods.\nA class may implement a number of Interfaces, but can extend only one abstract class.\nIn order for a class to implement an interface, it must implement all its declared methods. However, a class may not implement all declared methods of an abstract class. Though, in this case, the sub-class must also be declared as abstract.\nAbstract classes can implement interfaces without even providing the implementation of interface methods.\nVariables declared in a Java interface is by default final. An abstract class may contain non-final variables.\nMembers of a Java interface are public by default.

The HashMap requires a hash function and uses hashCode and equals methods, in order to put and retrieve elements to and from the collection respectively. When the put method is invoked, the HashMap calculates the hash value of the key and stores the pair in the appropriate index inside the collection. If the key exists, its value is updated with the new value. Some important characteristics of a HashMap are its capacity, its load factor and the threshold resizing."},{"question":"What differences exist between HashMap and Hashtable?","answer":"There are several differences 'tween HashMap and Hashtable in Java: Hashtable is synchronized, whereas HashMap is not. This makes HashMap better for non-threaded applications, as unsynchronized Objects typically perform better than synchronized ones. Hashtable does not allow null keys or values. HashMap allows one null key and any number of null values. One of HashMap's subclasses is LinkedHashMap, so in the event that you'd want predictable iteration order (which is insertion order by default), you could easily swap out the HashMap for a LinkedHashMap. This wouldn't be as easy if you were using Hashtable."},{"question":"What is JDBC?","answer":"JDBC is an abstraction bed that allows users to select between databases.

Enables you to write shorter code, by providing some syntactic sugar on top of JavaScript, which I think ES5 lacks, but ES2015 is awesome. Static types are awesome (in the case of TypeScript) for large projects that need to be maintained over time. Disadvantages: Require a build\/compile process as browsers only run JavaScript and your code will need to be compiled into JavaScript before being served to browsers. Debugging can be a pain if your source maps do not map nicely to your pre-compiled source. Most developers are not familiar with these languages and will need to learn it. There's a ramp up cost involved for your team if you use it for your projects. Smaller community (depends on the language), which means resources, tutorials, libraries, and tooling would be harder to find. IDE\/editor support might be lacking. These languages will always be behind the latest JavaScript standard. Developers should be cognizant of what their code is being compiled to \u2014 because that is what would actually be running, and that is what matters in the end. Practically, ES2015 has vastly improved JavaScript and made it much nicer to write. I don't really see the need for CoffeeScript these days."},{"question":"What linguistic_process grammatical_construction do you use for iterating over object properties and array items?","answer":"For objects:\nfor loops - for (var property in obj) { console.log(property); }. However, this will also iterate through its inherited properties, and you will add an obj.hasOwnProperty(property) check before using it.\nObject.keys() - Object.keys(obj).forEach(function (property) { ... }). Object.keys() is a static method that will lists all enumerable properties of the object that you pass it.\nObject.getOwnPropertyNames() - Object.getOwnPropertyNames(obj).forEach(function (property) { ... }). Object.getOwnPropertyNames() is a static method that will lists all enumerable and non-enumerable properties of the object that you pass it.\nFor arrays:\nfor loops - for (var i = 0; i < arr.length; i++). The common pitfall here is that var is in the function scope and not the block scope and most of the time you would want block scoped iterator variable. ES2015 introduces let which has block scope and it is recommended to use that instead. So this becomes: for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++).\nforEach - arr.forEach(function (el, index) { ... }). This construct can be more convenient at times because you do not have to use the index if all you need is the array elements. There are also the every and some methods which will allow you to terminate the iteration early.\nMost of the time, I would prefer the .forEach method, but it really depends on what you are trying to do. for loops allow more flexibility, such as prematurely terminate the loop using break or incrementing the iterator more than once per loop."},{"question":"What is let keyword indium JavaScript?","answer":"In addition to creating declarations for variables at the function level, ES6 lets you declare variables to belong to individual blocks (pairs of { .. }), using the let keyword."},{"question":"Explain what type_A recall function is and provide a simple example.","answer":"A callback function is a function that is passed to another function as an argument and is executed after some operation has been completed.

MSMQ can communicate between remote machines, even over Internet. It's free and comes with Windows, but is not installed by default.This mainly addresses the common use case of asynchronous message processing: you have a service Service1 that communicates (send messages) with another part of your software architecture, say Service2.Main problem: what if Service2 becomes suddenly unavailable? Will messages be lost? If you use MSMQ it won't: Service1 will send messages into a queue, and Service2 will dequeue when it is available.MSMQ will resolve following common issues: temporary unavailability of a service: messages are persisted on the disk and will be dequeued when the service becomes available again, so no messages are lost as it's fully asynchronous, it'll help a lot in case of punctual peak load: your Service2 won't die under the heavy load, it'll just dequeue and process messages, one after one"},{"question":"What is Queue in MSMQ?","answer":"The line_up is just deoxyadenosine_monophosphate container that stores messages, decoupling the sender from the receiver. MSMQ Queues are not necessarily FIFO (First In, First Out), because messages can be prioritized.Queues can be transactional or nontransactional. * Transactional Queues can only receive messages sent within a transactional context. * Nontransactional queues can only receive messages sent outside of a transactional context. Messages sent in a transactional context are processed in the order in which they were sent.[\u2b06] Machine Learning Interview Questions"},{"question":"What is Machine Learning?","answer":"political_machine hear is the study of algorithms and mathematical models that computer systems use to progressively improve their performance on a specific task.

In other words, they\u2019re helpful when the answer to your question about your business falls under a finite set of possible outcomes. Many use cases, such as determining whether an email is spam or not, have only two possible outcomes. This is called binary classification.Multi-label classification captures everything else, and is useful for customer segmentation, audio and image categorization, and text analysis for mining customer sentiment. If these are the questions you\u2019re hoping to answer with machine learning in your business, consider algorithms like naive Bayes, decision trees, logistic regression, kernel approximation, and K-nearest neighbors.RegressionOn the other hand, regression is useful for predicting outputs that are continuous. That means the answer to your question is represented by a quantity that can be flexibly determined based on the inputs of the model rather than being confined to a set of possible labels. Regression problems with time-ordered inputs are called time-series forecasting problems, like ARIMA forecasting, which allows data scientists to explain seasonal patterns in sales, evaluate the impact of new marketing campaigns, and more.Linear regression is by far the most popular example of a regression algorithm. Though it\u2019s often underrated because of its relative simplicity, it\u2019s a versatile method that can be used to predict housing prices, likelihood of customers to churn, or the revenue a customer will generate.

It includes such algorithms as linear and logistic regression, multi-class classification, and support vector machines. Supervised learning is so named because the data scientist acts as a guide to teach the algorithm what conclusions it should come up with. It\u2019s similar to the way a child might learn arithmetic from a teacher. Supervised learning requires that the algorithm\u2019s possible outputs are already known and that the data used to train the algorithm is already labeled with correct answers. For example, a classification algorithm will learn to identify animals after being trained on a dataset of images that are properly labeled with the species of the animal and some identifying characteristics.On the other hand, unsupervised machine learning is more closely aligned with what some call true artificial intelligence \u2014 the idea that a computer can learn to identify complex processes and patterns without a human to provide guidance along the way. Although unsupervised learning is prohibitively complex for some simpler enterprise use cases, it opens the doors to solving problems that humans normally would not tackle. Some examples of unsupervised machine learning algorithms include k-means clustering, principal and independent component analysis, and association rules.While a supervised classification algorithm learns to ascribe inputted labels to images of animals, its unsupervised counterpart will look at inherent similarities between the images and separate them into groups accordingly, assigning its own new label to each group. In a practical example, this type of algorithm is useful for customer segmentation because it will return groups based on parameters that a human may not consider due to pre-existing biases about the company\u2019s demographic.Choosing to use either a supervised or unsupervised machine learning algorithm typically depends on factors related to the structure and volume of your data and the use case of the issue at hand.

You could only use this from within a class. This should be used when you want to set some kind of constant option or setting that pertains to that class. Or maybe you want to create some kind of enum. An example of good const usage is to get rid of magic numbers. Define can be used for the same purpose, but it can only be used in the global scope. It should only be used for global settings that affect the entire application.Unless you need any type of conditional or expressional definition, use consts instead of define()- simply for the sake of readability!"},{"question":"What are the differences between die() and exit() functions in PHP?","answer":"There's no departure - they be the same.

If an exception is not caught, a PHP Fatal Error will be issued with an \"Uncaught Exception\". An exception can be thrown, and caught within PHP. To handle exceptions, code may be surrounded in a try block. Each try must have at least one corresponding catch block. Multiple catch blocks can be used to catch different classes of exceptions. Exceptions can be thrown (or re-thrown) within a catch block.Consider:php try { print \"this is our try block n\"; throw new Exception(); } catch (Exception $e) { print \"something went wrong, caught yah! n\"; } finally { print \"this part is always executed n\"; }"},{"question":"Is multiple inheritance supported in PHP?","answer":"PHP livelihood only single inheritance; IT means that a class can be extended from only one single class using the keyword 'extended'."},{"question":"How is it possible to set an infinite execution time for PHP script?","answer":"The set_time_limit(0)added at the showtime of a script sets to infinite the time of execution to not have the PHP error 'maximum execution time exceeded.'

They are basically web applications (Website) but have look and feel like other native mobile apps. The progressive web app enabled websites can offer functionalities such as working offline, push notifications, and device hardware access."},{"question":"Why do we need a web manifest for PWA?","answer":"A World_Wide_Web manifest file lists all the information about the website in a JSON format. Having this file is one of the requirements to make the website installable.It usually resides in the root folder of a web app. It contains useful information, such as the app\u2019s title, paths to different-sized icons that can be used to represent the app on a mobile OS (for example, as the home screen icon), and a background color to use in loading or splash screens. This information is needed for the browser to present the web app properly when installing, and on the home screen."},{"question":"What makes AN app a PWA?","answer":"There are some key principles a web app should try to observe to be identified as a PWA. It should be:\nDiscoverable, so the contents can be found through search engines.\nInstallable, so it's available on the device's home screen.\nLinkable, so you can share it by simply sending a URL. \n*** Network independent**, so it works offline or with a poor network connection.\nProgressive, so it's still usable on a basic level on older browsers, but fully-functional on the latest ones.\nRe-engageable, so it's able to send notifications whenever there's new content available.\nResponsive, so it's usable on any device with a screen and a browser \u2014 mobile phones, tablets, laptops, TVs, fridges, etc.\nSafe, so the connection between you and the app is secured against any third parties trying to get access to your sensitive data."},{"question":"What are some benefits of PWA?","answer":"gain of the reform-minded web app: Smaller and Faster: The progressive web apps are much smaller in size than native apps. They don\u2019t even need to install. That\u2019s they are not wasting disc space and load very fast. Responsive Interface: Progressive web app (PWA) supported web pages are capable to fit in every screen sizes automatically. It could be a smartphone, tablet, desktop or laptop. No Updates Required: Most of the mobile apps need regular weekly updates. Like the normal website, progressive web apps (PWA) are always loaded latest updated version whenever the user interaction happens and no App or Play Store approval required. Cost Effective: Native mobile apps need to be developed for both Android and iOS devices separately and their development cost is very high. On the other hand, progressive web apps are had the same features but the fraction of the prior price. SEO Advantage: Progressive web apps are discoverable by search engines and load super-fast. Just like other websites, their links are sharable too. This, in other words, gives good user experience and result in SEO rank boost. Offline capabilities: Due to the support of service worker API, PWAs are accessible in offline or low internet connections. Security: PWAs are delivered over HTTPS connection and secure user-data over each interaction. Push Notifications: By the support of push notifications, PWAs can interact easily with the users and provide a really amazing user experience. Bypass the app stores: PWAs don\u2019t need the App store or Google play store support. Their updated version can be directly loaded from the web server without the requirement of app store approval. On the other hand, native apps need days of approval if any new update required. There are possibilities of getting rejected or banned. Zero installation: During browsing, progressive web app gets its own icon on phones and tablets, just like a mobile application, but without the need to go through the tedious and slow App Store installation process.

React\u2019s core purpose is to build UI components; it is often referred to as just the \u201cV\u201d (View) in an \u201cMVC\u201d architecture."},{"question":"How would you write an inline style in React?","answer":"For example: ```html ``` #### What is JEST? **Jest** live type_A JavaScript unit testing framework made by Facebook based on Jasmine and provides automated mock creation and a jsdom environment. It's often used for testing React components. #### What are the advantages of ReactJS? Below are the advantages of ReactJS: 1. Increases the application\u2019s performance with Virtual DOM 2. JSX makes code is easy to read and write 3. It renders both on client and server side 4. Easy to integrate with other frameworks (Angular, BackboneJS) since it is only a view library 5. Easy to write UI Test cases and integration with tools such as JEST. #### How to write comments in ReactJS? The comments in ReactJS\/JSX is similar to javascript multiline comments which are wrapped with curly braces: **Single-line comments:** ```js {\/* Single-line comments *\/} Welcome {user}, Let's play React ``` **Multi-line comments:** ```js {\/* Multi-line comments for more than one line *\/} Welcome {user}, Let's play React ``` #### What is context? **Context** provides a way to pass data through the component tree without having to pass props down manually at every level. For example, authenticated user, locale preference, UI theme need to be accessed in the application by many components. ```js const {Provider, Consumer} = React.createContext(defaultValue); ``` #### What is virtual DOM? **The virtual DOM (VDOM)** is an in-memory representation of Real DOM. The representation of a UI is kept in memory and synced with the \u201creal\u201d DOM. It\u2019s a step that happens between the render function being called and the displaying of elements on the screen. This entire process is called reconciliation. #### How does React work? React creates a virtual DOM. When state changes in a component it firstly runs a \"diffing\" algorithm, which identifies what has changed in the virtual DOM. The second step is reconciliation, where it updates the DOM with the results of diff. #### What is the use of refs? The **ref** is used to return a reference to the element. They should be avoided in most cases, however, they can be useful when we need direct access to DOM element or an instance of a component. #### What is props in ReactJS? **Props** are inputs to a React component. They are single values or objects containing a set of values that are passed to React Components on creation using a naming convention similar to HTML-tag attributes. i.e, *They are data passed down from a parent component to a child component.* The primary purpose of props in React is to provide following component functionality: 1. Pass custom data to your React component. 2. Trigger `state` changes. 3. Use via `this.props.reactProp` inside component's `render()` method. For example, let us create an element with reactProp property, ```js ``` This `reactProp` (or whatever you came up with) name then becomes a property attached to React's native props object which originally already exists on all components created using React library. ```js props.reactProp; ``` #### What are the major features of ReactJS? The major features of ReactJS are as follows, - It uses **VirtualDOM** instead RealDOM considering that RealDOM manipulations are expensive. - Supports **server-side rendering** - Follows **Unidirectional** data flow or data binding - Uses **reusable\/composable** UI components to develop the view #### What is ReactJS? ReactJS is an **open-source frontend JavaScript library** which is used for building user interfaces especifically for single page applications. It is used for handling view layer for web and mobile apps. React was created by Jordan Walke, a software engineer working for Facebook. ReactJS was first deployed on Facebook\u2019s newsfeed in 2011 and on Instagram.com in 2012. #### What are props in React? Props are properties that are passed into a child component from its parent, and are readonly. #### What is Flux? Unidrectional application flow paradigm popular a few years back in React; mostly superceded by Redux these days. #### How error boundaries handled in React (15)? React15 provided very basic support for error boundaries using the method name **unstable_handleError**. Later this has been renamed as **componentDidCatch** starting from React16 beta release. #### What are the limitations of ReactJS? Below are the list of limitations: 1. React is just a view library, not a full-blown framework 2. There is a learning curve for beginners who are new to web development. 3. Integrating React.js into a traditional MVC framework requires some additional configuration 4. The code complexity increases with inline templating and JSX. 5. Too many smaller components leading to over-engineering or boilerplate #### What\u2019s the difference between an \"Element\" and a \"Component\" in React? Simply put, a React element describes what you want to see on the screen. Not so simply put, a React element is an object representation of some UI. A React component is a function or a class which optionally accepts input and returns a React element (typically via JSX which gets transpiled to a createElement invocation). #### What are stateful components? If the behaviour of a component is dependent on the state of the component then it can be termed as _stateful component_. These Stateful components are always class components and have a state that gets initialized in the constructor. ```js class App extends Component { constructor(props) { super(props); this.state = { count: 0 }; } render() { \/\/ omitted for brevity } } ``` #### What are stateless components? If the behaviour is independent of its state then it can be a _stateless component_. You can use either a function or a class for creating stateless components. But unless you need to use a lifecycle hook in your components, you should go for stateless functional components. There are a lot of benefits if you decide to use stateless functional components here; they are easy to write, understand, and test, and you can avoid the this keyword altogether. #### What are portals in ReactJS? Portal is a recommended way to render children into a DOM node that exists outside the DOM hierarchy of the parent component. ```js ReactDOM.createPortal(child, container); ``` The first argument (child) is any renderable React child, such as an element, string, or fragment. The second argument (container) is a DOM element. #### What are fragments? It's common pattern in React which is used for a component to return multiple elements. Fragments let you group a list of children without adding extra nodes to the DOM. ```js render() { return ( ); } ``` There is also a shorter syntax which is not supported in many tools ```js render() { return ( <> ); } ``` #### Why is it necessary to capitalize the components? It is necessary because components are not the DOM element but they are constructors. If they are not capitalized, they can cause various issues and can confuse developers with several elements. #### What is reconciliation? When a component\u2019s props or state change, React decides whether an actual DOM update is necessary by comparing the newly returned element with the previously rendered one. When they are not equal, React will update the DOM. This process is called **reconciliation**. #### What is the purpose of using super constructor with props argument? A child class constructor cannot make use of **this** reference until `super()` method has been called. The same applies for ES6 sub-classes as well. The main reason of passing props parameter to super() call is to access this.props in your child constructors. **Passing props:** ```js class MyComponent extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props); console.log(this.props); \/\/ Prints { name: 'sudheer',age: 30 } } } ``` **Not passing props:** ```js class MyComponent extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(); console.log(this.props); \/\/ Prints undefined \/\/ But Props parameter is still available console.log(props); \/\/ Prints { name: 'sudheer',age: 30 } } render() { \/\/ No difference outside constructor console.log(this.props) \/\/ Prints { name: 'sudheer',age: 30 } } } ``` The above code snippets reveals that this.props behavior is different only with in the constructor. It would be same outside the constructor. #### When to use a Class Component over a Functional Component? If the component need state or lifecycle methods then use class component otherwise use functional component. #### What are the advantages of using React? - It is easy to know how a component is rendered, you just need to look at the render function. - JSX makes it easy to read the code of your components. It is also really easy to see the layout, or how components are plugged\/combined with each other. - You can render React on the server-side. This enables improves SEO and performance. - It is easy to test. - You can use React with any framework (Backbone.js, Angular.js) as it is only a view layer. #### What are Higher-Order components? A higher-order component **(HOC)** is a function that takes a component and returns a new component. Basically, it\u2019s a pattern that is derived from React\u2019s compositional nature We call them as **\u201cpure\u2019 components\u201d** because they can accept any dynamically provided child component but they won\u2019t modify or copy any behavior from their input components. ```js const EnhancedComponent = higherOrderComponent(WrappedComponent); ``` HOC can be used for many use cases as below, 1. Code reuse, logic and bootstrap abstraction 2. Render High jacking 3. State abstraction and manipulation 4. Props manipulation #### What are controlled components? A ReactJS component that controls the input elements within the forms on subsequent user input is called **\u201cControlled component\u201d**. i.e, every state mutation will have an associated handler function. For example, to write all the names in uppercase letters, we use handleChange as below, ```js handleChange(event) { this.setState({ value: event.target.value.toUpperCase() }); } ``` #### What is the difference between a Presentational component and a Container component? * **Presentational components** are concerned with _how things look_. They generally receive data and callbacks exclusively via props. These components rarely have their own state, but when they do it generally concerns UI state, as opposed to data state. * **Container components** are more concerned with _how things work_. These components provide the data and behavior to presentational or other container components. They call Flux actions and provide these as callbacks to the presentational components. They are also often stateful as they serve as data sources. #### How to create refs? **Refs** are created using `React.createRef()` method and attached to React elements via the ref attribute. In order to use refs throughout the component, just assign the ref to the instance property with in constructor. ```js class MyComponent extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props); this.myRef = React.createRef(); } render() { return ; } } ``` And: ```js class UserForm extends Component { handleSubmit = () => { console.log(\"Input Value is: \", this.input.value) } render () { return ( this.input = input} \/> \/\/ Access DOM input in handle submit Submit ) } } ``` We can also use it in functional components with the help of closures. #### What are the differences between a class component and functional component? - **Class components** allows you to use additional features such as local state and lifecycle hooks. Also, to enable your component to have direct access to your store and thus holds state. - When your component just receives props and renders them to the page, this is a **stateless component**, for which a pure function can be used. These are also called dumb components or presentational components. #### How is React different from AngularJS (1.x)? For example, AngularJS (1.x) approaches building an application by extending HTML markup and injecting various constructs (e.g. Directives, Controllers, Services) at runtime. As a result, AngularJS is very opinionated about the greater architecture of your application \u2014 these abstractions are certainly useful in some cases, but they come at the cost of flexibility. By contrast, React focuses exclusively on the creation of components, and has few (if any) opinions about an application\u2019s architecture. This allows a developer an incredible amount of flexibility in choosing the architecture they deem \u201cbest\u201d \u2014 though it also places the responsibility of choosing (or building) those parts on the developer. #### What happens during the lifecycle of a React component? At the highest level, React components have lifecycle events that fall into three general categories: 1. Initialization 2. State\/Property Updates 3. Destruction #### What is the difference between state and props? The *state* is a data structure that starts with a default value when a Component mounts. It may be mutated across time, mostly as a result of user events. *Props* (short for properties) are a Component's configuration. They are received from above and immutable as far as the Component receiving them is concerned. A Component cannot change its props, but it is responsible for putting together the props of its child Components. Props do not have to just be data - callback functions may be passed in as props. #### What is inline conditional expressions? You can use either if statements or ternary expressions which are available from JS to conditionally render expressions. Apart from these approaches, you can also embed any expressions in JSX by wrapping them in curly braces and then followed by JS logical operator(&&). ```js Hello! {messages.length > 0 && You have {messages.length} unread messages. ``` #### How to pass a parameter to an event handler or callback? You can use an arrow function to wrap around an event handler and pass parameters: ```js this.handleClick(id)} \/> ``` This is equivalent to calling .bind as below, ```js ``` #### What is the purpose of callback function as an argument of setState? The callback function is invoked when `setState` finished and the component gets rendered. Since `setState` is **asynchronous** the callback function is used for any post action. **Note:** It is recommended to use lifecycle method rather this callback function. ```js setState({name: 'sudheer'}, () => console.log('The name has updated and component re-rendered')); ``` #### What happens when you call \"setState\"? The first thing React will do when setState is called is merge the object you passed into setState into the current state of the component. This will kick off a process called reconciliation. The end goal of reconciliation is to, in the most efficient way possible, update the UI based on this new state. To do this, React will construct a new tree of React elements (which you can think of as an object representation of your UI). Once it has this tree, in order to figure out how the UI should change in response to the new state, React will diff this new tree against the previous element tree. By doing this, React will then know the exact changes which occurred, and by knowing exactly what changes occurred, will able to minimize its footprint on the UI by only making updates where absolutely necessary. #### What is the difference between state and props? Both **props** and **state** are plain JavaScript objects. While both of them hold information that influences the output of render, they are different in their functionality with respect to component. i.e, * Props get passed to the component similar to function parameters * state is managed within the component similar to variables declared within a function. #### What is state in ReactJS? **State** of a component is an object that holds some information that may change over the lifetime of the component. We should always try to make our state as simple as possible and minimize the number of stateful components. Let's create user component with message state, ```js class User extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props); this.state = { message: \"Welcome to React world\", } } render() { return ( {this.state.message} ); } } ``` #### What are refs used for in React? *Refs* are an escape hatch which allow you to get direct access to a DOM element or an instance of a component. In order to use them you add a ref attribute to your component whose value is a callback function which will receive the underlying DOM element or the mounted instance of the component as its first argument. ```js class UnControlledForm extends Component { handleSubmit = () => { console.log(\"Input Value: \", this.input.value) } render () { return ( this.input = input} \/> Submit ) } } ``` Above notice that our input field has a ref attribute whose value is a function. That function receives the actual DOM element of input which we then put on the instance in order to have access to it inside of the handleSubmit function. It\u2019s often misconstrued that you need to use a class component in order to use refs, but refs can also be used with functional components by leveraging closures in JavaScript. ```js function CustomForm ({handleSubmit}) { let inputElement return ( handleSubmit(inputElement.value)}> inputElement = input} \/> Submit ) } ``` #### When rendering a list what is a key and what is it's purpose? *Keys* help React identify which items have changed, are added, or are removed. Keys should be given to the elements inside the array to give the elements a stable identity. The best way to pick a key is to use a string that uniquely identifies a list item among its siblings. ```js render () { return ( {this.state.todoItems.map(({task, uid}) => { return {task} })} ) } ``` Most often you would use IDs from your data as keys. When you don't have stable IDs for rendered items, you may use the item index as a key as a last resort. It is not recommend to use indexes for keys if the items can reorder, as that would be slow. #### How to create components in ReactJS? There are two possible ways to create ReactJS Components. 1. **Functional components:** This is the simplest way to create ReactJS components. It accepts props as an Object and returns ReactJS elements. We call it as \u201cfunctional\u201d because those are pure JavaScript functions. ```js function Greeting(props) { return Hello, {props.message} } ``` 2. **Class components:** You can also use Es6 class to define component. The above functional component can be written as below, ```js class Greeting extends React.Component { render() { return Hello, {this.props.message}; } } ``` #### What is the difference between Element and Component? An **element** is a plain object describing what you want to appear on the screen in terms of the DOM nodes or other components. Elements can contain other elements in their props. Creating a React element is cheap. Once an element is created, it is never mutated. The object representation of React element would be as follows, ```js const element = React.createElement( 'div', {id: 'login-btn'}, 'Login' ) ``` The above createElement returns as object as below, ```js { type: 'div', props: { children: 'Login', id: 'login-btn' } } ``` And finally it renders to the DOM using ReactDOM.render as below, ```js Login ``` Whereas a **component** can be declared in several different ways. It can be a class with a render() method. Alternatively, in simple cases, it can be defined as a function. In either case, it takes props as an input, and returns an element tree as the output. JSX transpiled as createElement at the end. ```js function Button ({ onLogin }) { return React.createElement( 'div', {id: 'login-btn', onClick: onLogin}, 'Login' ) } ``` #### What is JSX? JSX is a syntax notation for **JavaScript XML**(XML-like syntax extension to ECMAScript). It stands for JavaScript XML. It provides expressiveness of JavaScript along with HTML like template syntax. For example, the below text inside h1 tag return as javascript function to the render function, ```js render(){ return( Welcome to React world!! ); } ``` #### Describe how events are handled in React. In order to solve cross browser compatibility issues, your event handlers in React will be passed instances of SyntheticEvent, which is React\u2019s cross-browser wrapper around the browser\u2019s native event. These synthetic events have the same interface as native events you\u2019re used to, except they work identically across all browsers. What\u2019s mildly interesting is that React doesn\u2019t actually attach events to the child nodes themselves. React will listen to all events at the top level using a single event listener. This is good for performance and it also means that React doesn\u2019t need to worry about keeping track of event listeners when updating the DOM. #### Where in a React component should you make an AJAX request? `componentDidMount` is where an AJAX request should be made in a React component. This method will be executed when the component \u201cmounts\u201d (is added to the DOM) for the first time. This method is only executed once during the component\u2019s life. Importantly, you can\u2019t guarantee the AJAX request will have resolved before the component mounts. If it doesn't, that would mean that you\u2019d be trying to setState on an unmounted component, which would not work. Making your AJAX request in `componentDidMount` will guarantee that there\u2019s a component to update. #### What is the difference between component and container in react Redux? **Component** is part of the React API. A Component is a class or function that describes part of a React UI. **Container** is an informal term for a React component that is connected to a redux store. Containers receive Redux state updates and dispatch actions, and they usually don't render DOM elements; they delegate rendering to presentational child components. #### Where is the state kept in a React + Redux application? In the store. #### What is the difference between React Native and React? * **ReactJS** is a JavaScript library, supporting both front end web and being run on the server, for building user interfaces and web applications. * **React Native** is a mobile framework that compiles to native app components, allowing you to build native mobile applications (iOS, Android, and Windows) in JavaScript that allows you to use ReactJS to build your components, and implements ReactJS under the hood. #### How do we pass a property from a parent component props to a child component? For example: ```html ``` #### What is the point of Redux? Application state management that is easy to reason about, maintain and manage in an asynchronous web application environment. #### What does it mean for a component to be mounted in React? It has a corresponding element created in the DOM and is connected to that. #### What is Flow? **Flow** is a static type checker, designed to find type errors in JavaScript programs, created by Facebook. Flow types can express much more fine-grained distinctions than traditional type systems. For example, Flow helps you catch errors involving null, unlike most type systems. #### What happens when you call setState? The state property is updated in a React component with the object passed into setState, and this is done asynchronously. It tells React that this component and its children need to be re-rendered, but React may not do this immediately (it may batch these state update requests for better performance). #### What's the difference between a controlled component and an uncontrolled one in React? * A controlled component has its state completely driven by React, * Uncontrolled components can maintain their own internal state. E.g., a textarea's value. #### How would you prevent a component from rendering in React? Return `null` from the render method. #### How do you prevent the default behavior in an event callback in React? You call `e.preventDefault();` on the event e passed into the callback."},{"question":"What is Angular Framework?","answer":"Angular exist a TypeScript-based open-source front-end platform that makes it easy to build web, mobile and desktop applications.

You can store your component's template in one of two places. You can define it inline using the template property, or you can define the template in a separate HTML file and link to it in the component metadata using the @Component decorator's templateUrl property. Using inline template with template syntax, ```typescript import { Component } from '@angular\/core';@Component ({ selector: 'my-app', template: ' {{title}} Learn Angular ' })export class AppComponent { title: string = 'Hello World'; } **Using separate template file such as app.component.html**typescript import { Component } from '@angular\/core';@Component ({ selector: 'my-app', templateUrl: 'app\/app.component.html' })export class AppComponent { title: string = 'Hello World'; } ```"},{"question":"What live type_A module?","answer":"Modules are logical boundaries in your application and the application is divided into separate modules to separate the functionality of your application.\nLets take an example of app.module.ts root module declared with @NgModule decorator as below,\n```typescript\nimport { NgModule }      from '@angular\/core';\nimport { BrowserModule } from '@angular\/platform-browser';\nimport { AppComponent }  from '.\/app.component';@NgModule ({\n   imports:      [ BrowserModule ],\n   declarations: [ AppComponent ],\n   bootstrap:    [ AppComponent ],\n   providers: []\n})\nexport class AppModule { }\n```\nThe NgModule decorator has five important (among all) options:\n1.

Angular, or better Dependency Injector (DI), analyses the constructor parameters and when it creates a new instance by calling new MyClass() it tries to find providers that match the types of the constructor parameters, resolves them and passes them to the constructor. **ngOnInit** is a life cycle hook called by Angular to indicate that Angular is done creating the component. Mostly we use ngOnInit for all the initialization\/declaration and avoid stuff to work in the constructor. The constructor should only be used to initialize class members but shouldn't do actual \"work\". So you should use constructor() to setup Dependency Injection and not much else. ngOnInit() is better place to \"start\" - it's where\/when components' bindings are resolved. ```typescript export class App implements OnInit{ constructor(private myService: MyService){ \/\/called first time before the ngOnInit() }ngOnInit(){ \/\/called after the constructor and called after the first ngOnChanges() \/\/e.g. http call... } } ```"},{"question":"What is a service?","answer":"adenine service is used when a common functionality needs to be ply to various modules. Services allow for greater separation of concerns for your application and better modularity by allowing you to extract common functionality out of components.

By understanding these rules, you can determine in which NgModule, Component, or Directive you should declare a provider. Angular has two injector hierarchies:Module injectorWhen angular starts, it creates a root injector where the services will be registered, these are provided via injectable annotation. All services provided in the ng-model property are called providers (if those modules are not lazy-loaded).Angular recursively goes through all models which are being used in the application and creates instances for provided services in the root injector. If you provide some service in an eagerly-loaded model, the service will be added to the root injector, which makes it available across the whole application.Platform ModuleDuring application bootstrapping angular creates a few more injectors, above the root injector goes the platform injector, this one is created by the platform browser dynamic function inside the main.ts file, and it provides some platform-specific features like DomSanitizer. NullInjector()At the very top, the next parent injector in the hierarchy is the NullInjector().The responsibility of this injector is to throw the error if something tries to find dependencies there, unless you've used @Optional() because ultimately, everything ends at the NullInjector() and it returns an error or, in the case of @Optional(), null.ElementInjectorAngular creates ElementInjector hierarchies implicitly for each DOM element. ElementInjector injector is being created for any tag that matches the angular component, or any tag on which directive is applied, and you can configure it in component and directive annotations inside the provider's property, thus, it creates its own hierarchy likewise the upper one."},{"question":"What is the purpose of async pipe?","answer":"The AsyncPipe subscribes to an evident or promise and returns the latest treasure it has emitted.

The choice between inline and separate HTML is a matter of taste, circumstances, and organization policy. But normally we use inline template for small portion of code and external template file for bigger views. By default, the Angular CLI generates components with a template file. But you can override that with the below command, ng generate component hero -it"},{"question":"What is the purpose of *ngFor directive?","answer":"We habituate Angular `*ngFor` directive in the template to display each item in the list.

If you still use it then it will be ignored and a warning appears in the browser console.Let's take an example of innerHtml property binding which causes XSS vulnerability, typescript export class InnerHtmlBindingComponent { \/\/ For example, a user\/attacker-controlled value from a URL. htmlSnippet = 'Template <script>alert(\"0wned\")<\/script> <b>Syntax<\/b>'; }"},{"question":"What is interpolation?","answer":"interpolation is angstrom special syntax that Angular converts into property binding. It\u2019s a convenient alternative to property binding. It is represented by double curly braces({{}}). The text between the braces is often the name of a component property. Angular replaces that name with the string value of the corresponding component property.Let's take an example, html <h3> {{title}} <img src=\"{{url}}\" style=\"height:30px\"> <\/h3> In the example above, Angular evaluates the title and url properties and fills in the blanks, first displaying a bold application title and then a URL."},{"question":"What are template statements?","answer":"amp template statement responds to an event raised by a binding target such as an element, component, or directive. The template statements appear in quotes to the right of the = symbol like `(event)=\"statement\"`. Let's take an example of button click event's statementhtml <button (click)=\"editProfile()\">Edit Profile<\/button> In the above expression, editProfile is a template statement. The below JavaScript syntax expressions are not allowed. 1. new 2. increment and decrement operators, ++ and -- 3. operator assignment, such as += and -= 4. the bitwise operators | and & 5. the template expression operators"},{"question":"How do you categorize data binding types?","answer":"Binding types stool comprise grouped into three categories distinguished by the direction of data flow. They are listed as below, 1. From the source-to-view 2. From view-to-source 3. View-to-source-to-viewThe possible binding syntax can be tabularized as below,| Data direction | Syntax | Type | |---- | --------- | ---- | | From the source-to-view(One-way) | 1. {{expression}} 2. [target]=\"expression\" 3. bind-target=\"expression\" | Interpolation, Property, Attribute, Class, Style| | From view-to-source(One-way) | 1. (target)=\"statement\" 2. on-target=\"statement\" | Event | | View-to-source-to-view(Two-way)| 1. [(target)]=\"expression\" 2. bindon-target=\"expression\"| Two-way |"},{"question":"What are pipes?","answer":"Pipes are simple function that use [template expressions](#what-are-template-expressions) to accept data as input and transubstantiate it into a desired output. For example, let us take a pipe to transform a component's birthday property into a human-friendly date using **date** pipe. ```javascript import { Component } from '@angular\/core';@Component({ selector: 'app-birthday', template: <p>Birthday is {{ birthday | date }}<\/p> }) export class BirthdayComponent { birthday = new Date(1987, 6, 18); \/\/ June 18, 1987 } ```"},{"question":"What is a parameterized pipe?","answer":"A pipe can accept any amount of optional parameters to fine-tune its output. The parameterized pipe can be created by declaring the pipe name with a colon ( : ) and then the parameter value. If the pipe accepts multiple parameters, separate the values with colons. Let's take a birthday example with a particular format(dd\/MM\/yyyy): ```javascript import { Component } from '@angular\/core';@Component({ selector: 'app-birthday', template: `<p>Birthday is {{ birthday | date:'dd\/MM\/yyyy'}}<\/p>` \/\/ 18\/06\/1987 }) export class BirthdayComponent { birthday = new Date(1987, 6, 18); } ``` Note: The parameter value can be any valid template expression, such as a string literal or a component property."},{"question":"How do you chain pipes?","answer":"You stern chain pipe together in potentially useful combinations as per the needs. Let's take a birthday property which uses date pipe(along with parameter) and uppercase pipes as below ```javascript import { Component } from '@angular\/core'; @Component({ selector: 'app-birthday', template: `<p>Birthday is {{ birthday | date:'fullDate' | uppercase}} <\/p>` \/\/ THURSDAY, JUNE 18, 1987 }) export class BirthdayComponent { birthday = new Date(1987, 6, 18); } ```"},{"question":"What is a custom pipe?","answer":"asunder from constitutional pipes, you can write your own custom pipe with the below key characteristics: A pipe is a class decorated with pipe metadata @Pipe decorator, which you import from the core Angular library For example, javascript @Pipe({name: 'myCustomPipe'}) The pipe class implements the PipeTransform interface's transform method that accepts an input value followed by optional parameters and returns the transformed value. The structure of PipeTransform would be as below, javascript interface PipeTransform { transform(value: any, ...args: any[]): any } The @Pipe decorator allows you to define the pipe name that you'll use within template expressions. It must be a valid JavaScript identifier. javascript template: `{{someInputValue | myCustomPipe: someOtherValue}}`"},{"question":"Give an example of custom pipe?","answer":"You can create custom reusable hit for the transformation of existing value. For example, let us create a custom pipe for finding file size based on an extension, ```javascript import { Pipe, PipeTransform } from '@angular\/core'; @Pipe({name: 'customFileSizePipe'}) export class FileSizePipe implements PipeTransform { transform(size: number, extension: string = 'MB'): string { return (size \/ (1024 * 1024)).toFixed(2) + extension; } } Now you can use the above pipe in template expression as below,javascript template: <h2>Find the size of a file<\/h2> <p>Size: {{288966 | customFileSizePipe: 'GB'}}<\/p> ```"},{"question":"What is the difference between pure and impure pipe?","answer":"A pure shriek is merely called when Angular detects a change in the value or the parameters passed to a pipe. For example, any changes to a primitive input value (String, Number, Boolean, Symbol) or a changed object reference (Date, Array, Function, Object). An impure pipe is called for every change detection cycle no matter whether the value or parameters changes. i.e, An impure pipe is called often, as often as every keystroke or mouse-move."},{"question":"What is a bootstrapping module?","answer":"every application has astatine least one Angular module, the root module that you bootstrap to launch the application is called as bootstrapping module. It is commonly known as `AppModule`. The default structure of `AppModule` generated by AngularCLI would be as follows: ```javascript import { BrowserModule } from '@angular\/platform-browser'; import { NgModule } from '@angular\/core'; import { FormsModule } from '@angular\/forms'; import { HttpClientModule } from '@angular\/common\/http';import { AppComponent } from '.\/app.component'; \/* the AppModule class with the @NgModule decorator *\/ @NgModule({ declarations: [ AppComponent ], imports: [ BrowserModule, FormsModule, HttpClientModule ], providers: [], bootstrap: [AppComponent] }) export class AppModule { } ```"},{"question":"What is HttpClient and its benefits?","answer":"Most of the Front-end applications communicate with backend help over `HTTP` protocol victimization either `XMLHttpRequest` interface or the `fetch()` API. Angular provides a simplified client HTTP API known as `HttpClient` which is based on top of `XMLHttpRequest` interface. This client is avaialble from `@angular\/common\/http` package. You can import in your root module as below: javascript import { HttpClientModule } from '@angular\/common\/http';The major advantages of HttpClient can be listed as below, 1. Contains testability features 2. Provides typed request and response objects 3. Intercept request and response 4. Supports Observalbe APIs 5. Supports streamlined error handling"},{"question":"explicate along how to use HttpClient with an example?","answer":"Below are the steps need to be followed for the usage of `HttpClient`.\n\nImport HttpClient into root module:\n    javascript\n    import { HttpClientModule } from '@angular\/common\/http';\n    @NgModule({\n      imports: [\n        BrowserModule,\n        \/\/ import HttpClientModule after BrowserModule.\n        HttpClientModule,\n      ],\n      ......\n      })\n     export class AppModule {}\n\nInject the HttpClient into the application:\n    Let's create a userProfileService(userprofile.service.ts) as an example. It also defines get method of HttpClient:\n    ```javascript\n    import { Injectable } from '@angular\/core';\n    import { HttpClient } from '@angular\/common\/http';\nconst userProfileUrl: string = 'assets\/data\/profile.json';\n@Injectable()\nexport class UserProfileService {\n  constructor(private http: HttpClient) { }\ngetUserProfile() {\n    return this.http.get(this.userProfileUrl);\n  }\n}\n3. Create a component for subscribing service:\nLet's create a component called UserProfileComponent(`userprofile.component.ts`), which injects `UserProfileService` and invokes the service method:javascript\nfetchUserProfile() {\n  this.userProfileService.getUserProfile()\n    .subscribe((data: User) => this.user = {\n        id: data['userId'],\n        name: data['firstName'],\n        city:  data['city']\n    });\n}\n```\n    Since the above service method returns an Observable which needs to be subscribed in the component."},{"question":"How can you say full response?","answer":"The response body doesn't or may not return full response data because sometimes servers also return special headers or status code, which are important for the application workflow. In order to get the full response, you should use `observe` option from `HttpClient`:\njavascript\ngetUserResponse(): Observable<HttpResponse<User>> {\n  return this.http.get<User>(\n    this.userUrl, { observe: 'response' });\n}\nNow HttpClient.get() method returns an Observable of typed HttpResponse rather than just the JSON data."},{"question":"How do you perform Error handling?","answer":"If the call_for break on the server or fails to reach the server due to network issues, then `HttpClient` will return an error object instead of a successful reponse. In this case, you need to handle in the component by passing `error` object as a second callback to `subscribe()` method. Let's see how it can be handled in the component with an example, javascript fetchUser() { this.userService.getProfile() .subscribe( (data: User) => this.userProfile = { ...data }, \/\/ success path error => this.error = error \/\/ error path ); } It is always a good idea to give the user some meaningful feedback instead of displaying the raw error object returned from HttpClient."},{"question":"What is RxJS?","answer":"RxJS is angstrom_unit library for composing asynchronous and callback-based code IN a functional, reactive style using Observables. Many APIs such as HttpClient produce and consume RxJS Observables and also uses operators for processing observables. For example, you can import observables and operators for using HttpClient as below, javascript import { Observable, throwError } from 'rxjs'; import { catchError, retry } from 'rxjs\/operators';"},{"question":"What equal an observer?","answer":"Observer is an interface for a consumer of push-based notifications delivered by an Observable. It has below structure,\njavascript\ninterface Observer<T> {\n  closed?: boolean;\n  next: (value: T) => void;\n  error: (err: any) => void;\n  complete: () => void;\n}\nA handler that implements the Observer interface for receiving observable notifications will be passed as a parameter for observable as below,javascript\nmyObservable.subscribe(myObserver);\nNote: If you don't supply a handler for a notification type, the observer ignores notifications of that type."},{"question":"What is the difference between promise and observable?","answer":"below live the list of differences between promise and observable: | Observable | Promise | |---- | --------- | | Declarative: Computation does not start until subscription, so they can run whenever you need the result | Executes immediately on creation| | Provides multiple values over time | Provides only one | | Subscribe method is used for error handling that facilitates centralized and predictable error handling | Push errors to the child promises | | Provides chaining and subscription to handle complex applications | Uses only .then() clause |"},{"question":"What is multicasting?","answer":"Multi-casting equal the praxis of broadcasting to a list of multiple subscribers in a single execution. Let's demonstrate the multi-casting feature: ```javascript var source = Rx.Observable.from([1, 2, 3]); var subject = new Rx.Subject(); var multicasted = source.multicast(subject);\/\/ These are, under the hood, subject.subscribe({...}): multicasted.subscribe({ next: (v) => console.log('observerA: ' + v) }); multicasted.subscribe({ next: (v) => console.log('observerB: ' + v) });\/\/ This is, under the hood, `s ```"},{"question":"How do you perform error handling in observables?","answer":"You buns handle errors by specifying an **error callback** on the observer instead of relying on `try`\/`catch`, which are ineffective in asynchronous environment. For example, you can define error callback as below, javascript myObservable.subscribe({ next(num) { console.log('Next num: ' + num)}, error(err) { console.log('Received an errror: ' + err)} });"},{"question":"What is the shorthand notation for subscribe method?","answer":"The `subscribe()` method commode take callback function definitions in line, for `next`, `error`, and `complete` handlers. It is known as shorthand notation or Subscribe method with positional arguments. For example, you can define subscribe method as below, javascript myObservable.subscribe( x => console.log('Observer got a next value: ' + x), err => console.error('Observer got an error: ' + err), () => console.log('Observer got a complete notification') );"},{"question":"What are the utility functions provided by RxJS?","answer":"The RxJS library besides leave below utility functions for creating and working with observables.

Let us explain each of them with an example: Create an observable from a promise javascript import { from } from 'rxjs'; \/\/ from function const data = from(fetch('\/api\/endpoint')); \/\/Created from Promise data.subscribe({ next(response) { console.log(response); }, error(err) { console.error('Error: ' + err); }, complete() { console.log('Completed'); } }); Create an observable that creates an AJAX request javascript import { ajax } from 'rxjs\/ajax'; \/\/ ajax function const apiData = ajax('\/api\/data'); \/\/ Created from AJAX request \/\/ Subscribe to create the request apiData.subscribe(res => console.log(res.status, res.response)); Create an observable from a counter javascript import { interval } from 'rxjs'; \/\/ interval function const secondsCounter = interval(1000); \/\/ Created from Counter value secondsCounter.subscribe(n => console.log(`Counter value: ${n}`)); Create an observable from an event javascript import { fromEvent } from 'rxjs'; const el = document.getElementById('custom-element'); const mouseMoves = fromEvent(el, 'mousemove'); const subscription = mouseMoves.subscribe((e: MouseEvent) => { console.log(`Coordnitaes of mouse pointer: ${e.clientX} * ${e.clientY}`); });"},{"question":"What bequeath materialize if you do not supply handler for the observer?","answer":"Usually, an observer object can define any combination of `next`, `error`, and `complete` notification type handlers. If you don't supply a handler for a notification type, the observer just ignores notifications of that type."},{"question":"What are Angular elements?","answer":"Angular constituent are angular components packaged as **custom elements** (a web standard for defining new HTML elements in a framework-agnostic way). Angular Elements host an Angular component, providing a bridge between the data and the logic defined in the component and the standard DOM APIs, thus, providing a way to use Angular components in `non-Angular environments`."},{"question":"What is the browser support of Angular Elements?","answer":"Since angular elements represent packaged as custom elements the browser support of angular elements is same as custom elements support. This feature is is currently supported natively in a number of browsers and pending for other browsers.| Browser | Angular Element Support | |---- | --------- | | Chrome | Natively supported| | Opera | Natively supported | | Safari| Natively supported | | Firefox | Natively supported from 63 version onwards.

The browser maintains a `CustomElementRegistry` of defined custom elements, which maps an instantiable JavaScript class to an HTML tag. Currently this feature is supported by Chrome, Firefox, Opera, and Safari, and available in other browsers through polyfills."},{"question":"Explain how custom elements works internally?","answer":"down_the_stairs are the stride in an order about custom elements functionality, App registers custom element with browser: Use the createCustomElement() function to convert a component into a class that can be registered with the browser as a custom element. App adds custom element to DOM: Add custom element just like a built-in HTML element directly into the DOM. Browser instantiate component based class: Browser creates an instance of the registered class and adds it to the DOM. Instance provides content with data binding and change detection: The content with in template is rendered using the component and DOM data. The flow chart of the custom elements functionality would be as follows,"},{"question":"How to transfer components to custom elements?","answer":"translate constituent to custom elements involves **two** major steps, Build custom element class: Angular provides the createCustomElement() function for converting an Angular component (along with its dependencies) to a custom element. The conversion process implements NgElementConstructor interface, and creates a constructor class which is used to produce a self-bootstrapping instance of Angular component. Register element class with browser: It uses customElements.define() JS function, to register the configured constructor and its associated custom-element tag with the browser's CustomElementRegistry. When the browser encounters the tag for the registered element, it uses the constructor to create a custom-element instance. The detailed structure would be as follows,"},{"question":"What are the mapping rules between Angular component and custom element?","answer":"The Component dimension and logic maps directly into HTML attributes and the browser's event system. Let us describe them in two steps, The createCustomElement() API parses the component input properties with corresponding attributes for the custom element. For example, component @Input('myInputProp') converted as custom element attribute my-input-prop. The Component outputs are dispatched as HTML Custom Events, with the name of the custom event matching the output name. For example, component @Output() valueChanged = new EventEmitter() converted as custom element with dispatch event as \"valueChanged\"."},{"question":"How brawl you define typings for custom elements?","answer":"You can use the `NgElement` and `WithProperties` types exported from @angular\/elements.\nLet's see how it can be applied by comparing with Angular component.\n1.

If app folder is the application root then you can set the href value as below html <base href=\"\/\">"},{"question":"What personify the router imports?","answer":"The Angular Router which represents a particular component view for a given URL is not part of Angular Core. It is available in library named `@angular\/router` to import required router components. For example, we import them in app module as below,\njavascript\nimport { RouterModule, Routes } from '@angular\/router';"},{"question":"What is router outlet?","answer":"The RouterOutlet equal angstrom directive from the router library and it acts as a placeholder that marks the spot in the template where the router should display the components for that outlet. Router outlet is used like a component, html <router-outlet><\/router-outlet> <!-- Routed components go here -->"},{"question":"What are router links?","answer":"The RouterLink cost a directing on the anchor tags give the router control over those elements. Since the navigation paths are fixed, you can assign string values to router-link directive as below, html <h1>Angular Router<\/h1> <nav> <a routerLink=\"\/todosList\" >List of todos<\/a> <a routerLink=\"\/completed\" >Completed todos<\/a> <\/nav> <router-outlet><\/router-outlet>"},{"question":"What are active router links?","answer":"RouterLinkActive is angstrom_unit directive that toggles atomic_number_55 classes for active RouterLink bindings based on the current RouterState. i.e, The Router will add CSS classes when this link is active and remove when the link is inactive. For example, you can add them to RouterLinks as below. html <h1>Angular Router<\/h1> <nav> <a routerLink=\"\/todosList\" routerLinkActive=\"active\">List of todos<\/a> <a routerLink=\"\/completed\" routerLinkActive=\"active\">Completed todos<\/a> <\/nav> <router-outlet><\/router-outlet>"},{"question":"What embody router state?","answer":"RouterState is a tree of activated routes.

It can also be used to traverse the router state tree. The ActivatedRoute will be injected as a router service to access the information. In the below example, you can access route path and parameters, javascript @Component({...}) class MyComponent { constructor(route: ActivatedRoute) { const id: Observable<string> = route.params.pipe(map(p => p.id)); const url: Observable<string> = route.url.pipe(map(segments => segments.join(''))); \/\/ route.data includes both `data` and `resolve` const user = route.data.pipe(map(d => d.user)); } }"},{"question":"What is the purpose of Wildcard route?","answer":"If the URL doesn't gibe any predefined routes and_so it causes the router to throw an error and crash the app. In this case, you can use wildcard route. A wildcard route has a path consisting of two asterisks to match every URL. For example, you can define PageNotFoundComponent for wildcard route as below javascript { path: '**', component: PageNotFoundComponent }"},{"question":"Do I need a Routing Module always?","answer":"No, the Routing Module be a invention choice. You can skip routing Module (for example, AppRoutingModule) when the configuration is simple and merge the routing configuration directly into the companion module (for example, AppModule). But it is recommended when the configuration is complex and includes specialized guard and resolver services."},{"question":"What is Angular Universal?","answer":"Angular Universal live a server-side rendering module for angulate applications in various scenarios. This is a community driven project and available under @angular\/platform-server package. Recently Angular Universal is integrated with Angular CLI."},{"question":"What are different types of compilation in Angular?","answer":"angulate pass two ways to compile your application, Just-in-Time (JIT) Ahead-of-Time (AOT)"},{"question":"What is JIT?","answer":"Just-in-Time (JIT) is axerophthol case of compilation that compiles your app in the browser at runtime. JIT compilation was the default until Angular 8, now default is AOT. When you run the ng build (build only) or ng serve (build and serve locally) CLI commands, the type of compilation (JIT or AOT) depends on the value of the aot property in your build configuration specified in angular.json. By default, aot is set to true."},{"question":"Why do we need compilation process?","answer":"The angulate components and guide cannot be understood by the browser directly. Due to that Angular applications require a compilation process before they can run in a browser. For example, In AOT compilation, both Angular HTML and TypeScript code converted into efficient JavaScript code during the build phase before browser runs it."},{"question":"What are the advantages with AOT?","answer":"Below exist the list of AOT benefits, dissolute rendering: The browser downloads a pre-compiled version of the application. So it can render the application immediately without compiling the app. Fewer asynchronous requests: It inlines external HTML templates and CSS style sheets within the application javascript which eliminates separate ajax requests. Smaller Angular framework download size: Doesn't require downloading the Angular compiler. Hence it dramatically reduces the application payload. Detect template errors earlier: Detects and reports template binding errors during the build step itself Better security: It compiles HTML templates and components into JavaScript. So there won't be any injection attacks."},{"question":"What are the ways to control AOT compilation?","answer":"You can control your app digest in two ways, away providing template compiler options in the tsconfig.json file By configuring Angular metadata with decorators"},{"question":"What are the three phases of AOT?","answer":"The AOT compiler run in three phases, code Analysis: The compiler records a representation of the source Code generation: It handles the interpretation as well as places restrictions on what it interprets. Validation: In this phase, the Angular template compiler uses the TypeScript compiler to validate the binding expressions in templates."},{"question":"Can I use arrow functions in AOT?","answer":"No, pointer functions Oregon lambda functions can\u2019t be used to assign values to the decorator properties. For example, the following snippet is invalid: javascript @Component({ providers: [{ provide: MyService, useFactory: () => getService() }] })To fix this, it has to be changed as following exported function:```javascript function getService(){ return new MyService(); }@Component({ providers: [{ provide: MyService, useFactory: getService }] }) ```If you still use arrow function, it generates an error node in place of the function. When the compiler later interprets this node, it reports an error to turn the arrow function into an exported function. Note: From Angular5 onwards, the compiler automatically performs this rewriting while emitting the .js file."},{"question":"What is the purpose of metadata json files?","answer":"The metadata.json file_cabinet rear be treated as a diagram of the overall structure of a decorator's metadata, represented as an abstract syntax tree(AST). During the analysis phase, the AOT collector scan the metadata recorded in the Angular decorators and outputs metadata information in .metadata.json files, one per .d.ts file."},{"question":"john single use any javascript feature for expression syntax in AOT?","answer":"No, the AOT collector understands a subset  of (or limited) JavaScript features. If an expression uses unsupported syntax, the collector writes an error node to the .metadata.json file. Later point of time, the compiler reports an error if it needs that piece of metadata to generate the application code."},{"question":"What is folding?","answer":"The compiler lavatory only resolve extension to exported symbols in the metadata. Where as some of the non-exported members are folded while generating the code. i.e Folding is a process in which the collector evaluate an expression during collection and record the result in the .metadata.json instead of the original expression. For example, the compiler couldn't refer selector reference because it is not exported javascript let selector = 'app-root'; @Component({ selector: selector }) Will be folded into inline selectorjavascript @Component({ selector: 'app-root' }) Remember that the compiler can\u2019t fold everything. For example, spread operator on arrays, objects created using new keywords and function calls."},{"question":"What are macros?","answer":"The AOT compiler underpin macros in the form of functions or static methods that return an expression in a `single return expression`. For example, let us take a below macro function, javascript export function wrapInArray<T>(value: T): T[] { return [value]; }You can use it inside metadata as an expression,javascript @NgModule({ declarations: wrapInArray(TypicalComponent) }) export class TypicalModule {}The compiler treats the macro expression as it written directlyjavascript @NgModule({ declarations: [TypicalComponent] }) export class TypicalModule {}"},{"question":"Give an example of few metadata errors?","answer":"Below represent just_about of the errors encountered in metadata, Expression form not supported: Some of the language features outside of the compiler's restricted expression syntax used in angular metadata can produce this error. Let's see some of these examples, ```javascript export class User { ... } const prop = typeof User; \/\/ typeof is not valid in metadata { provide: 'token', useValue: { [prop]: 'value' } }; \/\/ bracket notation is not valid in metadata ``` Reference to a local (non-exported) symbol: The compiler encountered a referenced to a locally defined symbol that either wasn't exported or wasn't initialized. Let's take example of this error, ```javascript \/\/ ERROR let username: string; \/\/ neither exported nor initialized @Component({ selector: 'my-component', template: ... , providers: [ { provide: User, useValue: username } ] }) export class MyComponent {} You can fix this by either exporting or initializing the value,javascript export let username: string; \/\/ exported (or) let username = 'John'; \/\/ initialized 3. **Function calls are not supported:** The compiler does not currently support function expressions or lambda functions. For example, you cannot set a provider's useFactory to an anonymous function or arrow function as below.javascript providers: [ { provide: MyStrategy, useFactory: function() { ... } }, { provide: OtherStrategy, useFactory: () => { ... } } ] You can fix this with exported functionjavascript export function myStrategy() { ... } export function otherStrategy() { ... } ... \/\/ metadata providers: [ { provide: MyStrategy, useFactory: myStrategy }, { provide: OtherStrategy, useFactory: otherStrategy }, 4. **Destructured variable or constant not supported:** The compiler does not support references to variables assigned by destructuring. For example, you cannot write something like this:javascript import { user } from '.\/user'; \/\/ destructured assignment to name and age const {name, age} = user; ... \/\/metadata providers: [ {provide: Name, useValue: name}, {provide: Age, useValue: age}, ] You can fix this by non-destructured valuesjavscript import { user } from '.\/user'; ... \/\/metadata providers: [ {provide: Name, useValue: user.name}, {provide: Age, useValue: user.age}, ] ```"},{"question":"What is metadata rewriting?","answer":"Metadata rewriting is the process in which the compiling_program converts the expression initializing the fields such as useClass, useValue, useFactory, and data into an exported variable, which replaces the expression. Remember that the compiler does this rewriting during the emit of the .js file but not in definition files( .d.ts file)."},{"question":"How do you put_up configuration inheritance?","answer":"Angular Compiler supports configuration inheritance through extends in the tsconfig.json on angularCompilerOptions. i.e, The configuration from the base file(for example, tsconfig.base.json) are loaded first, then overridden by those in the inheriting config file.\njavascript\n{\n  \"extends\": \"..\/tsconfig.base.json\",\n  \"compilerOptions\": {\n    \"experimentalDecorators\": true,\n    ...\n  },\n  \"angularCompilerOptions\": {\n    \"fullTemplateTypeCheck\": true,\n    \"preserveWhitespaces\": true,\n    ...\n  }\n}"},{"question":"How do you specify angular template compiler options?","answer":"The angular template compiler options are specified as members of the **angularCompilerOptions** object in the tsconfig.json file. These options will be specified adjecent to typescript compiler options. javascript { \"compilerOptions\": { \"experimentalDecorators\": true, ... }, \"angularCompilerOptions\": { \"fullTemplateTypeCheck\": true, \"preserveWhitespaces\": true, ... } }"},{"question":"How do you enable binding expression validation?","answer":"You rear_end enable binding expression validation explicitly by adding the compiler option **fullTemplateTypeCheck** in the \"angularCompilerOptions\" of the project's tsconfig.json. It produces error messages when a type error is detected in a template binding expression. For example, consider the following component: javascript @Component({ selector: 'my-component', template: '{{user.contacts.email}}' }) class MyComponent { user?: User; } This will produce the following error: javascript my.component.ts.MyComponent.html(1,1): : Property 'contacts' does not exist on type 'User'. Did you mean 'contact'?"},{"question":"What is the intent of any type cast function?","answer":"You can disable binding expression type checking using $any() type cast function(by surrounding the expression). In the following example, the error Property contacts does not exist is suppressed by casting user to the any type.\n```javascript\n  template:\n  '{{ $any(user).contacts.email }}'\n```\nThe $any() cast function also works with this to allow access to undeclared members of the component.\n```javascript\n   template:\n   '{{ $any(this).contacts.email }}'\n```"},{"question":"What is Non null type assertion operator?","answer":"You send_away manipulation the non-null type assertion operator to suppress the Object is possibly 'undefined' error. In the following example, the user and contact properties are always set together, implying that contact is always non-null if user is non-null. The error is suppressed in the example by using contact!.email. ```javascript @Component({ selector: 'my-component', template: '<span *ngIf=\"user\"> {{user.name}} contacted through {{contact!.email}} <\/span>' }) class MyComponent { user?: User; contact?: Contact; setData(user: User, contact: Contact) { this.user = user; this.contact = contact; } } ```"},{"question":"What is type narrowing?","answer":"The expression used inwards an ngIf directive is used to narrow type unions in the Angular template compiler similar to if expression in typescript. So *ngIf allows the typeScript compiler to infer that the data used in the binding expression will never be undefined. ```javascript @Component({ selector: 'my-component', template: '<span *ngIf=\"user\"> {{user.contact.email}} <\/span>' }) class MyComponent { user?: User; } ```"},{"question":"How do you describe various dependencies in angular application?","answer":"The dependency section of package.json with inch an angular application can be divided as follow, Angular packages: Angular core and optional modules; their package names begin @angular\/.

This function takes two arguments: a unique name like open or closed and a style() function. For example, you can write a open state functionjavascript state('open', style({ height: '300px', opacity: 0.5, backgroundColor: 'blue' })),"},{"question":"What is Style function?","answer":"The style use is utilise to define a set of styles to associate with a given state name. You need to use it along with state() function to set CSS style attributes. For example, in the close state, the button has a height of 100 pixels, an opacity of 0.8, and a background color of green. javascript state('close', style({ height: '100px', opacity: 0.8, backgroundColor: 'green' })), Note: The style attributes must be in camelCase."},{"question":"What is the purpose of animate function?","answer":"angular Animations follow a powerful way to implement sophisticated and compelling animations for your Angular single page web application. ```javascript import { Component, OnInit, Input } from '@angular\/core'; import { trigger, state, style, animate, transition } from '@angular\/animations'; @Component({ selector: 'app-animate', templateUrl: `<div [@changeState]=\"currentState\" class=\"myblock mx-auto\"><\/div>`, styleUrls: `.myblock { background-color: green; width: 300px; height: 250px; border-radius: 5px; margin: 5rem; }`, animations: [ trigger('changeState', [ state('state1', style({ backgroundColor: 'green', transform: 'scale(1)' })), state('state2', style({ backgroundColor: 'red', transform: 'scale(1.5)' })), transition('*=>state1', animate('300ms')), transition('*=>state2', animate('2000ms')) ]) ] }) export class AnimateComponent implements OnInit { @Input() currentState; constructor() { } ngOnInit() { } } ```"},{"question":"What follow transition function?","answer":"The animation transition function is used to specify the changes that occur between one state and another over a period of time. It accepts two arguments: the first argument accepts an expression that defines the direction between two transition states, and the second argument accepts an animate() function.\nLet's take an example state transition from open to closed with an half second transition between states.javascript\n transition('open => closed', [\n   animate('500ms')\n ]),"},{"question":"How to inject the dynamic script in angular?","answer":"Using DomSanitizer we can inject the dynamical Html,Style,Script,Url. import { Component, OnInit } from '@angular\/core'; moment { DomSanitizer } from '@angular\/platform-browser'; @Component({ selector: 'my-app', template: ` <div [innerHtml]=\"htmlSnippet\"><\/div> `, }) export class App { constructor(protected sanitizer: DomSanitizer) {} htmlSnippet: string = this.sanitizer.bypassSecurityTrustScript(\"<script>safeCode()<\/script>\"); }"},{"question":"What is a service worker and its role in Angular?","answer":"type_A serve worker is a script that runs in the web browser and manages caching for an application.

So it is recommended to use offline template compiler in production deployments without dynamically generating any template."},{"question":"What be the various security contexts Hoosier_State Angular?","answer":"Angular defines the following security contexts for sanitization,\n\nHTML: It is used when interpreting a value as HTML such as binding to innerHtml.\nStyle: It is used when binding CSS into the style property.\nURL: It is used for URL properties such as <a href>.\nResource URL: It is a URL that will be loaded and executed as code such as <script src>."},{"question":"What is Sanitization? Is angular supports it?","answer":"**Sanitization** is the inspection of AN untrusted value, release it into a value that's safe to insert into the DOM. Yes, Angular suppports sanitization. It sanitizes untrusted values for HTML, styles, and URLs but sanitizing resource URLs isn't possible because they contain arbitrary code."},{"question":"What is the purpose of innerHTML?","answer":"The innerHtml live axerophthol property of HTML-Elements, which allows you to set it's html-content programmatically. Let's display the below html code snippet in a `<div>` tag as below using innerHTML binding, html <div [innerHTML]=\"htmlSnippet\"><\/div> and define the htmlSnippet property from any component javascript export class myComponent { htmlSnippet: string = '<b>Hello World<\/b>, Angular'; } Unfortunately this property could cause Cross Site Scripting (XSS) security bugs when improperly handled."},{"question":"What is the difference between interpolated content and innerHTML?","answer":"The independent difference between interpolated and innerHTML codification is the behavior of code interpreted. Interpolated content is always escaped i.e, HTML isn't interpreted and the browser displays angle brackets in the element's text content. Where as in innerHTML binding, the content is interpreted i.e, the browser will convert < and > characters as HTMLEntities. For example, the usage in template would be as below, html <p>Interpolated value:<\/p> <div >{{htmlSnippet}}<\/div> <p>Binding of innerHTML:<\/p> <div [innerHTML]=\"htmlSnippet\"><\/div> and the property defined in a component.javascript export class InnerHtmlBindingComponent { htmlSnippet = 'Template <script>alert(\"XSS Attack\")<\/script> <b>Code attached<\/b>'; } Even though innerHTML binding create a chance of XSS attack, Angular recognizes the value as unsafe and automatically sanitizes it."},{"question":"How do you prevent automatic sanitization?","answer":"sometimes the practical_application genuinely need to include executable code such as displaying `<iframe>` from an URL. In this case, you need to prevent automatic sanitization in Angular by saying that you inspected a value, checked how it was generated, and made sure it will always be secure. Basically it involves 2 steps, Inject DomSanitizer: You can inject DomSanitizer in component as parameter in constructor Mark the trusted value by calling some of the below methods bypassSecurityTrustHtml bypassSecurityTrustScript bypassSecurityTrustStyle bypassSecurityTrustUrl bypassSecurityTrustResourceUrl For example,The usage of dangerous url to trusted url would be as below,javascript constructor(private sanitizer: DomSanitizer) { this.dangerousUrl = 'javascript:alert(\"XSS attack\")'; this.trustedUrl = sanitizer.bypassSecurityTrustUrl(this.dangerousUrl);"},{"question":"Is safe to use direct DOM API methods in terms of security?","answer":"No,the built-in browser DOM APIs or methods don't automatically protect you from security vulnerabilities. In this case IT is recommended to use Angular templates instead of directly interacting with DOM. If it is unavoidable then use the built-in Angular sanitization functions."},{"question":"What cost DOM sanitizer?","answer":"`DomSanitizer` is used to help preventing Cross Site Scripting Security bugs (XSS) by sanitizing values to be safe to use in the different DOM contexts."},{"question":"Is angular prevents http level vulnerabilities?","answer":"angular have built-in support for preventing http level vulnerabilities such as as cross-site request forgery (CSRF or XSRF) and cross-site script inclusion (XSSI). Even though these vulnerabilities need to be mitigated on server-side, Angular provides helpers to make the integration easier on the client side. HttpClient supports a token mechanism used to prevent XSRF attacks HttpClient library recognizes the convention of prefixed JSON responses(which non-executable js code with \")]}',\\n\" characters) and automatically strips the string \")]}',\\n\" from all responses before further parsing"},{"question":"What personify the covering of HTTP interceptors?","answer":"The HTTP Interceptors can be used for different variety of tasks,\n\nAuthentication\nLogging\nCaching\nFake backend\nURL transformation\nModifying headers"},{"question":"Is multiple interceptors supported in Angular?","answer":"Yes, angulate supports multiple interceptors astatine a time. You could define multiple interceptors in providers property: ```javascript providers: [ { provide: HTTP_INTERCEPTORS, useClass: MyFirstInterceptor, multi: true }, { provide: HTTP_INTERCEPTORS, useClass: MySecondInterceptor, multi: true } ], ``` The interceptors will be called in the order in which they were provided. i.e, MyFirstInterceptor will be called first in the above interceptors configuration."},{"question":"How can I use interceptor for an entire application?","answer":"You can use same instance of `HttpInterceptors` for the entire app away importation the `HttpClientModule` only in your AppModule, and add the interceptors to the root application injector. For example, let's define a class that is injectable in root application. ```javascript @Injectable() export class MyInterceptor implements HttpInterceptor { intercept( req: HttpRequest<any>, next: HttpHandler ): Observable<HttpEvent<any>> { return next.handle(req).do(event => { if (event instanceof HttpResponse) { \/\/ Code goes here } }); } } After that import HttpClientModule in AppModulejavascript @NgModule({ declarations: [AppComponent], imports: [BrowserModule, HttpClientModule], providers: [ { provide: HTTP_INTERCEPTORS, useClass: MyInterceptor, multi: true } ], bootstrap: [AppComponent] }) export class AppModule {} ```"},{"question":"How fare angular simplifies Internationalization?","answer":"Angular simplifies the below areas of internationalization,\n 1. Displaying dates, number, percentages, and currencies in a local format.\n 2. Preparing text in component templates for translation.\n 3. Handling plural forms of words.\n 4. Handling alternative text."},{"question":"How do you manually register locale data?","answer":"by default, Angular entirely contains locale data for en-US which is English as spoken in the United States of America . But if you want to set to another locale, you must import locale data for that new locale. After that you can register using `registerLocaleData` method and the syntax of this method looks like below, ```javascript registerLocaleData(data: any, localeId?: any, extraData?: any): void ``` For example, let us import German locale and register it in the application ```javascript import { registerLocaleData } from '@angular\/common'; import localeDe from '@angular\/common\/locales\/de'; registerLocaleData(localeDe, 'de'); ```"},{"question":"What are the four phases of template translation?","answer":"The i18n template translation appendage has four phases: Mark static text messages in your component templates for translation: You can place i18n on every element tag whose fixed text is to be translated. For example, you need i18n attribue for heading as below, javascript <h1 i18n>Hello i18n!<\/h1> Create a translation file: Use the Angular CLI xi18n command to extract the marked text into an industry-standard translation source file. i.e, Open terminal window at the root of the app project and run the CLI command xi18n. bash ng xi18n The above command creates a file named messages.xlf in your project's root directory. Note: You can supply command options to change the format, the name, the location, and the source locale of the extracted file. Edit the generated translation file: Translate the extracted text into the target language. In this step, create a localization folder (such as locale)under root directory(src) and then create target language translation file by copying and renaming the default messages.xlf file. You need to copy source text node and provide the translation under target tag. For example, create the translation file(messages.de.xlf) for German language javascript <trans-unit id=\"greetingHeader\" datatype=\"html\"> <source>Hello i18n!<\/source> <target>Hallo i18n !<\/target> <note priority=\"1\" from=\"description\">A welcome header for this sample<\/note> <note priority=\"1\" from=\"meaning\">welcome message<\/note> <\/trans-unit> Merge the completed translation file into the app: You need to use Angular CLI build command to compile the app, choosing a locale-specific configuration, or specifying the following command options. --i18nFile=path to the translation file --i18nFormat=format of the translation file --i18nLocale= locale id"},{"question":"What is the purpose of i18n attribute?","answer":"The angulate i18n attribute strike_off translatable content. It is a custom attribute, recognized by Angular tools and compilers. The compiler removes it after translation. Note: Remember that i18n is not an Angular directive."},{"question":"What is the purpose of custom id?","answer":"When you interchange the translatable text, the angulate extractor tool generates a new id for that translation unit. Because of this behavior, you must then update the translation file with the new id every time. For example, the translation file messages.de.xlf.html has generated trans-unit for some text message as below html <trans-unit id=\"827wwe104d3d69bf669f823jjde888\" datatype=\"html\"> You can avoid this manual update of id attribute by specifying a custom id in the i18n attribute by using the prefix @@. javascript <h1 i18n=\"@@welcomeHeader\">Hello i18n!<\/h1>"},{"question":"What happens if the custom id is not unique?","answer":"You call_for to limit custom ids as unique. If you use the same id for two different text messages then only the first one is extracted. But its translation is used in place of both original text messages. For example, let's define same custom id myCustomId for two messages, html <h2 i18n=\"@@myCustomId\">Good morning<\/h3> <!-- ... --> <h2 i18n=\"@@myCustomId\">Good night<\/p> and the translation unit generated for first text in for German language as html <trans-unit id=\"myId\" datatype=\"html\"> <source>Good morning<\/source> <target state=\"new\">Guten Morgen<\/target> <\/trans-unit> Since custom id is the same, both of the elements in the translation contain the same text as below html <h2>Guten Morgen<\/h2> <h2>Guten Morgen<\/h2>"},{"question":"Can I translate text without creating an element?","answer":"Yes, you can achieve using `<ng-container>` attribute. usually you need to wrap a text content with i18n attribute for the translation. But if you don't want to create a new DOM element just for the sake of translation, you can wrap the text in an <ng-container> element. ```html <ng-container i18n>I'm not using any DOM element for translation<\/ng-container> ``` Remember that `<ng-container>` is transformed into an html comment"},{"question":"How can I translate attribute?","answer":"You can interpret dimension by attaching `i18n-x` attribute where x is the name of the attribute to translate. For example, you can translate image title attribute as below, ```html <img [src]=\"example\" i18n-title title=\"Internationlization\" \/> ``` By the way, you can also assign meaning, description and id with the i18n-x=\"<meaning>|<description>@@<id>\" syntax."},{"question":"List down the pluralization categories?","answer":"Pluralization ingest below categories depending on the language. =0 (or any other number) zero single two few many other"},{"question":"What is select ICU expression?","answer":"ICU reflection is constitute similar to the plural expressions except that you choose among alternative translations based on a string value instead of a number. Here you define those string values. Let's take component binding with residenceStatus property which has \"citizen\", \"permanent resident\" and \"foreigner\" possible values and the message maps those values to the appropriate translations. javascript <span i18n>The person is {residenceStatus, select, citizen {citizen} permanent resident {permanentResident} foreigner {foreigner}}<\/span>"},{"question":"How do you report missing translations?","answer":"By default, When translation is missing, IT generates a warning message such as \"Missing translation for message 'somekey'\". But you can configure with a different level of message in Angular compiler as below, Error: It throws an error. If you are using AOT compilation, the build will fail. But if you are using JIT compilation, the app will fail to load. Warning (default): It shows a 'Missing translation' warning in the console or shell. Ignore: It doesn't do anything. If you use AOT compiler then you need to perform changes in configurations section of your Angular CLI configuration file, angular.json. javascript \"configurations\": { ... \"de\": { ... \"i18nMissingTranslation\": \"error\" } } If you use the JIT compiler, specify the warning level in the compiler config at bootstrap by adding the 'MissingTranslationStrategy' property as below, ```javascript import { MissingTranslationStrategy } from '@angular\/core'; import { platformBrowserDynamic } from '@angular\/platform-browser-dynamic'; import { AppModule } from '.\/app\/app.module';platformBrowserDynamic().bootstrapModule(AppModule, { missingTranslation: MissingTranslationStrategy.Error, providers: [ \/\/ ... ] }); ```"},{"question":"How do you provide build configuration for multiple locales?","answer":"You can provide build configuration such antiophthalmic_factor translation file path, name, format and application url in `configuration` settings of Angular.json file. For example, the German version of your application configured the build as follows, ```javascript \"configurations\": { \"de\": { \"aot\": true, \"outputPath\": \"dist\/my-project-de\/\", \"baseHref\": \"\/fr\/\", \"i18nFile\": \"src\/locale\/messages.de.xlf\", \"i18nFormat\": \"xlf\", \"i18nLocale\": \"de\", \"i18nMissingTranslation\": \"error\", } ```"},{"question":"What is an angular library?","answer":"Associate_in_Nursing Angular library be an Angular project that differs from an app in that it cannot run on its own. It must be imported and used in an app. For example, you can import or add `service worker` library to an Angular application which turns an application into a Progressive Web App (PWA). Note: You can create own third party library and publish it as npm package to be used in an Application."},{"question":"What is AOT compiler?","answer":"The AOT compiler is share of a build process that produces a small, fast, ready-to-run application package, typically for production. It converts your Angular HTML and TypeScript code into efficient JavaScript code during the build phase before the browser downloads and runs that code."},{"question":"How do you select an element Hoosier_State portion template?","answer":"You can control any DOM element via ElementRef by injecting it into your component's constructor. i.e, The component should have constructor with ElementRef parameter,\n ```javascript\n constructor(myElement: ElementRef) {\n    el.nativeElement.style.backgroundColor = 'yellow';\n }\n ```"},{"question":"What is TestBed?","answer":"TestBed represent Associate_in_Nursing api for writing unit tests for Angular applications and it's libraries. Even though We still write our tests in Jasmine and run using Karma, this API provides an easier way to create components, handle injection, test asynchronous behaviour and interact with our application."},{"question":"What personify protractor?","answer":"Protractor is an end-to-end test framework for Angular and AngularJS applications. It runs tests against your application running in a real browser, interacting with it as a user would.\n ```javascript\n npm install -g protractor\n ```"},{"question":"What is collection?","answer":"Collection is A set of related schematic_drawing collected in an npm package. For example, `@schematics\/angular` collection is used in Angular CLI to apply transforms to a web-app project. You can create your own schematic collection for customizing angular projects."},{"question":"How do you make schematics for libraries?","answer":"You can create your own schematic collections to integrate your library with the Angular CLI. These collections are classified as 3 main schematics,\n\nAdd schematics: These schematics are used to install library in an Angular workspace using ng add command.\n    For example, @angular\/material schematic tells the add command to install and set up Angular Material and theming.\nGenerate schematics: These schematics are used to modify projects, add configurations and scripts, and scaffold artifacts in library using ng generate command.\n    For example, @angular\/material generation schematic supplies generation schematics for the UI components. Let's say the table component is generated using ng generate @angular\/material:table.\nUpdate schematics: These schematics are used to update library's dependencies and adjust for breaking changes in a new library release using ng update command.\n    For example, @angular\/material update schematic updates material and cdk dependencies using ng update @angular\/material command."},{"question":"How do you use jquery in Angular?","answer":"You can use jquery in angular utilise 3 simple steps, Install the dependency: At first, install the jquery dependency using npm cmd npm install --save jquery Add the jquery script: In Angular-CLI project, add the relative path to jquery in the angular.json file. javascript \"scripts\": [ \"node_modules\/jquery\/dist\/jquery.min.js\" ] Start using jquery: Define the element in template.

It generates all your components with predefined sass files. ```javascript ng new My_New_Project --style=sass ``` But if you are changing your existing style in your project then use `ng set` command, ```javascript ng set defaults.styleExt scss ```"},{"question":"What is the propose of hide property?","answer":"The hidden property is used  to show or hide the associated DOM element, based on an expression. It can be compared close to `ng-show` directive in AngularJS. Let's say you want to show user name based on the availability of user using `hidden` property.\n ```javascript\n <div [hidden]=\"!user.name\">\n   My name is: {{user.name}}\n <\/div>\n ```"},{"question":"What is the difference between ngIf and hidden property?","answer":"The main difference_of_opinion is that *ngIf will remove the element from the DOM, spell [hidden] actually plays with the CSS style by setting `display:none`. Generally it is expensive to add and remove stuff from the DOM for frequent actions."},{"question":"What is slice pipe?","answer":"The fade pipe cost used to create a new Array or String containing a subset (slice) of the elements. The syntax looks like as below, ```javascript {{ value_expression | slice : start [ : end ] }} ``` For example, you can provide 'hello' list based on a greeting array, ```javascript @Component({ selector: 'list-pipe', template: `<ul> <li *ngFor=\"let i of greeting | slice:0:5\">{{i}}<\/li> <\/ul>` }) export class PipeListComponent { greeting: string[] = ['h', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o', 'm','o', 'r', 'n', 'i', 'n', 'g']; } ```"},{"question":"What is exponent holding in ngFor directive?","answer":"The index property of the NgFor directive is used to return the zero-based index of the item in each iteration. You can capture the index in a template input variable and use it in the template.\nFor example, you can capture the index in a variable named indexVar and displays it with the todo's name using ngFor directive as below.\n javascript\n <div *ngFor=\"let todo of todos; let i=index\">{{i + 1}} - {{todo.name}}<\/div>"},{"question":"What is the purpose of ngFor trackBy?","answer":"The independent purpose of using *ngFor with trackBy option is performance optimization. Normally if you use NgFor with large data sets, a small change to one item by removing or adding an item, can trigger a cascade of DOM manipulations. In this case, Angular sees only a fresh list of new object references and to replace the old DOM elements with all new DOM elements. You can help Angular to track which items added or removed by providing a `trackBy` function which takes the index and the current item as arguments and needs to return the unique identifier for this item. For example, lets set trackBy to the trackByTodos() method javascript <div *ngFor=\"let todo of todos; trackBy: trackByTodos\"> ({{todo.id}}) {{todo.name}} <\/div> and define the trackByTodos method, javascript trackByTodos(index: number, item: Todo): number { return todo.id; }"},{"question":"What is the purpose of ngSwitch directive?","answer":"**NgSwitch** guiding is similar to JavaScript switch statement which displays one element from among several possible elements, based on a switch condition. In this case only the selected element placed into the DOM. It has been used along with `NgSwitch`, `NgSwitchCase` and `NgSwitchDefault` directives. For example, let's display the browser details based on selected browser using ngSwitch directive. javascript <div [ngSwitch]=\"currentBrowser.name\"> <chrome-browser *ngSwitchCase=\"'chrome'\" [item]=\"currentBrowser\"><\/chrome-browser> <firefox-browser *ngSwitchCase=\"'firefox'\" [item]=\"currentBrowser\"><\/firefox-browser> <opera-browser *ngSwitchCase=\"'opera'\" [item]=\"currentBrowser\"><\/opera-browser> <safari-browser *ngSwitchCase=\"'safari'\" [item]=\"currentBrowser\"><\/safari-browser> <ie-browser *ngSwitchDefault [item]=\"currentItem\"><\/ie-browser> <\/div>"},{"question":"Is it possible to do aliasing for inputs and outputs?","answer":"Yes, information_technology is potential to do aliasing for inputs and outputs in two ways.

Component initialization: While bootstrapping the Angular application, Angular triggers the ApplicationRef.tick() to call change detection and View Rendering. Event listener: The DOM event listener can update the data in an Angular component and trigger the change detection too. ``js @Component({ selector: 'app-event-listener', template: Click {{message}}` }) export class EventListenerComponent { message = ''; onClick() { this.message = 'data updated'; } } 3. **HTTP Data Request:** You can get data from a server through an HTTP requestjs data = 'default value'; constructor(private httpClient: HttpClient) {} ngOnInit() { this.httpClient.get(this.serverUrl).subscribe(response => { this.data = response.data; \/\/ change detection will happen automatically }); } 4. **Macro tasks setTimeout() or setInterval():** You can update the data in the callback function of setTimeout or setIntervaljs data = 'default value'; ngOnInit() { setTimeout(() => { this.data = 'data updated'; \/\/ Change detection will happen automatically }); } 5. **Micro tasks Promises:** You can update the data in the callback function of promisejs data = 'initial value'; ngOnInit() { Promise.resolve(1).then(v => { this.data = v; \/\/ Change detection will happen automatically }); } ``` 6.

For example, when you call setTimeout() js onScheduleTask: function(delegate, curr, target, task) { console.log('new task is scheduled:', task.type, task.source); return delegate.scheduleTask(target, task); } onInvokeTask: This hook triggers when an asynchronous task is about to execute. For example, when the callback of setTimeout() is about to execute. js onInvokeTask: function(delegate, curr, target, task, applyThis, applyArgs) { console.log('task will be invoked:', task.type, task.source); return delegate.invokeTask(target, task, applyThis, applyArgs); } onHasTask: This hook triggers when the status of one kind of task inside a zone changes from stable(no tasks in the zone) to unstable(a new task is scheduled in the zone) or from unstable to stable. js onHasTask: function(delegate, curr, target, hasTaskState) { console.log('task state changed in the zone:', hasTaskState); return delegate.hasTask(target, hasTaskState); } onInvoke: This hook triggers when a synchronous function is going to execute in the zone. js onInvoke: function(delegate, curr, target, callback, applyThis, applyArgs) { console.log('the callback will be invoked:', callback); return delegate.invoke(target, callback, applyThis, applyArgs); }"},{"question":"What are the methods of NgZone used to control change detection?","answer":"NgZone religious_service provides a `run()` method that allows you to execute a function inside the angular zone. This function is used to execute third party APIs which are not handled by Zone and trigger change detection automatically at the correct time. ```js export class AppComponent implements OnInit { constructor(private ngZone: NgZone) {} ngOnInit() { \/\/ use ngZone.run() to make the asynchronous operation in the angular zone this.ngZone.run(() => { someNewAsyncAPI(() => { \/\/ update the data of the component }); }); } } ``` Whereas `runOutsideAngular()` method is used when you don't want to trigger change detection. ```js export class AppComponent implements OnInit { constructor(private ngZone: NgZone) {} ngOnInit() { \/\/ Use this method when you know no data will be updated this.ngZone.runOutsideAngular(() => { setTimeout(() => { \/\/ update component data and don't trigger change detection }); }); } } ```"},{"question":"How do you change the settings of zonejs?","answer":"You can switch the scope of zone by configuring them in a separate file and import it just after zonejs import. For example, you can disable the requestAnimationFrame() monkey patch to prevent change detection for no data update as one setting and prevent DOM events(a mousemove or scroll event) to trigger change detection. Let's say the new file named zone-flags.js, ```js \/\/ disable patching requestAnimationFrame (window as any).__Zone_disable_requestAnimationFrame = true; \/\/ disable patching specified eventNames (window as any).__zone_symbol__UNPATCHED_EVENTS = ['scroll', 'mousemove']; The above configuration file can be imported in a polyfill.ts file as below,js \/************** * Zone JS is required by default for Angular. \/ import .\/zone-flags; import 'zone.js\/dist\/zone'; \/\/ Included with Angular CLI. ```"},{"question":"How do you trigger an animation?","answer":"Angular provides angstrom `trigger()` social_occasion for animation in order to collect the states and transitions with a specific animation name, so that you can attach it to the triggering element in the HTML template. This function watch for changes and trigger initiates the actions when a change occurs. For example, let's create trigger named `upDown`, and attach it to the button element. ```js content_copy @Component({ selector: 'app-up-down', animations: [ trigger('upDown', [ state('up', style({ height: '200px', opacity: 1, backgroundColor: 'yellow' })), state('down', style({ height: '100px', opacity: 0.5, backgroundColor: 'green' })), transition('up => down', [ animate('1s') ]), transition('down => up', [ animate('0.5s') ]), ]), ], templateUrl: 'up-down.component.html', styleUrls: ['up-down.component.css'] }) export class UpDownComponent { isUp = true; toggle() { this.isUp = !this.isUp; }```"},{"question":"How do you configure injectors with providers at different levels?","answer":"You can configure injector with providers at unlike levels of your application by setting a metadata value. The configuration can happen in one of three places, In the @Injectable() decorator for the service itself In the @NgModule() decorator for an NgModule In the @Component() decorator for a component"},{"question":"Is it mandatory to use injectable on every service class?","answer":"ordinal_number The `@Injectable()` ornamentalist is not strictly required if the class has other Angular decorators on it or does not have any dependencies. But the important thing here is any class that is going to be injected with Angular is decorated. i.e, If we add the decorator, the metadata `design:paramtypes` is added, and the dependency injection can do it's job. That is the exact reason to add the @Injectable() decorator on a service if this service has some dependencies itself. For example, Let's see the different variations of AppService in a root component, The below AppService can be injected in AppComponent without any problems. This is because there are no dependency services inside AppService. js export class AppService { constructor() { console.log('A new app service'); } } The below AppService with dummy decorator and httpService can be injected in AppComponent without any problems. This is because meta information is generated with dummy decorator. ```js function SomeDummyDecorator() { return (constructor: Function) => console.log(constructor); } @SomeDummyDecorator() export class AppService { constructor(http: HttpService) { console.log(http); } } and the generated javascript code of above service has meta information about HttpService,js var AppService = (function () { function AppService(http) { console.log(http); } AppService = __decorate([ core_1.Injectable(), __metadata('design:paramtypes', [http_service_1.HttpService]) ], AppService); return AppService; }()); exports.AppService = AppService; 3. The below AppService with @injectable decorator and httpService can be injected in AppComponent without any problems. This is because meta information is generated with Injectable decorator.js @Injectable({ providedIn: 'root', }) export class AppService { constructor(http: HttpService) { console.log(http); } } ```"},{"question":"What is an optional dependency?","answer":"The optional dependency constitute a parameter decorator to be used on constructor parameters, which marks the parameter as being an optional dependency. Due to this, the DI framework provides null if the dependency is not found. For example, If you don't register a logger provider anywhere, the injector sets the value of logger(or logger service) to null in the below class. ```js import { Optional } from '@angular\/core'; constructor(@Optional() private logger?: Logger) { if (this.logger) { this.logger.log('This is an optional dependency message'); } else { console.log('The logger is not registered'); } } ```"},{"question":"What are the types of injector hierarchies?","answer":"There comprise two types of injector hierarchy in Angular ModuleInjector hierarchy: It configure on a module level using an @NgModule() or @Injectable() annotation. ElementInjector hierarchy: It created implicitly at each DOM element. Also it is empty by default unless you configure it in the providers property on @Directive() or @Component()."},{"question":"What are reactive forms?","answer":"Reactive forms live a model-driven approach for creating forms IN a reactive style(form inputs changes over time). These are built around observable streams, where form inputs and values are provided as streams of input values. Let's follow the below steps to create reactive forms, Register the reactive forms module which declares reactive-form directives in your app ```js import { ReactiveFormsModule } from '@angular\/forms'; @NgModule({ imports: [ \/\/ other imports ...

The main use cases are simple checks like whether a field is empty, whether it exceeds a maximum length etc. Async validators: These are the asynchronous functions which take a control instance and return a Promise or Observable that later emits a set of validation errors or null. Also, these functions passed as second argument while instantiating the form control. The main use cases are complex validations like hitting a server to check the availability of a username or email. The representation of these validators looks like below js this.myForm = formBuilder.group({ firstName: ['value'], lastName: ['value', *Some Sync validation function*], email: ['value', *Some validation function*, *Some asynchronous validation function*] });"},{"question":"Can you give an example of built-in validators?","answer":"In reactive forms, you bum use inherent validator like `required` and `minlength` on your input form controls. For example, the registration form can have these validators on name input field ```js this.registrationForm = new FormGroup({ 'name': new FormControl(this.hero.name, [ Validators.required, Validators.minLength(4), ]) }); ``` Whereas in template-driven forms, both `required` and `minlength` validators available as attributes."},{"question":"How do you optimize the performance of async validators?","answer":"Since all validators fly_the_coop after every form value change, it creates a major impact on performance with async validators by hitting the external API on each keystroke. This situation can be avoided by delaying the form validity by changing the updateOn property from change (default) to submit or blur. The usage would be different based on form types, Template-driven forms: Set the property on ngModelOptions directive html <input [(ngModel)]=\"name\" [ngModelOptions]=\"{updateOn: 'blur'}\"> Reactive-forms: Set the property on FormControl instance js name = new FormControl('', {updateOn: 'blur'});"},{"question":"How to fix ngFor and ngIf along the same element?","answer":"Sometimes you may need to both ngFor and ngIf on the same element but unfortunately you are going to encounter below template error.\n ```cmd\n  Template parse errors: Can't have multiple template bindings on one element.\n ```\n  In this case, You need to use either ng-container or ng-template.\n  Let's say if you try to loop over the items only when the items are available, the below code throws an error in the browser\n  ```html\n  <ul *ngIf=\"items\" *ngFor=\"let item of items\">\n    <li><\/li>\n  <\/ul>\n  ```\n  and it can be fixed by\n  ```html\n  <ng-container *ngIf=\"items\">\n    <ul *ngFor=\"let item of items\">\n      <li><\/li>\n    <\/ul>\n  <\/ng-container>\n  ```"},{"question":"What is host property in css?","answer":"The `:host` pseudo-class selector represent used to target styles in the element that hosts the component. Since the host element is in a parent component's template, you can't reach the host element from inside the component by other means. For example, you can create a border for parent element as below, ```js \/\/Other styles for app.component.css \/\/... :host { display: block; border: 1px solid black; padding: 20px; } ```"},{"question":"How do you get the current route?","answer":"Hoosier_State Angular, there embody an `url` property of router package to get the current route.

Currying is named after a mathematician Haskell Curry. By applying currying, a n-ary function turns it into a unary function.Let's take an example of n-ary function and how it turns into a currying function,```javascript const multiArgFunction = (a, b, c) => a + b + c; console.log(multiArgFunction(1, 2, 3)); \/\/ 6const curryUnaryFunction = (a) => (b) => (c) => a + b + c; curryUnaryFunction(1); \/\/ returns a function: b => c => 1 + b + c curryUnaryFunction(1)(2); \/\/ returns a function: c => 3 + c curryUnaryFunction(1)(2)(3); \/\/ returns the number 6 ```Curried functions are great to improve code reusability and functional composition."},{"question":"What is a pure function","answer":"A Pure subprogram exist a function where the return value is only determined by its arguments without any side effects. i.e, If you call a function with the same arguments 'n' number of times and 'n' number of places in the application then it will always return the same value.Let's take an example to see the difference between pure and impure functions,```javascript \/\/Impure let numberArray = []; const impureAddNumber = (number) => numberArray.push(number); \/\/Pure const pureAddNumber = (number) => (argNumberArray) => argNumberArray.concat([number]);\/\/Display the results console.log(impureAddNumber(6)); \/\/ returns 1 console.log(numberArray); \/\/ returns [6] console.log(pureAddNumber(7)(numberArray)); \/\/ returns [6, 7] console.log(numberArray); \/\/ returns [6] ```As per the above code snippets, the Push function is impure itself by altering the array and returning a push number index independent of the parameter value. . Whereas Concat on the other hand takes the array and concatenates it with the other array producing a whole new array without side effects. Also, the return value is a concatenation of the previous array.Remember that Pure functions are important as they simplify unit testing without any side effects and no need for dependency injection. They also avoid tight coupling and make it harder to break your application by not having any side effects. These principles are coming together with Immutability concept of ES6 by giving preference to * const over let* usage."},{"question":"What is the purpose of the let keyword","answer":"The Lashkar-e-Taiba command declares a block scope local variable. Hence the variables defined with let keyword are limited in scope to the block, statement, or expression on which it is used. Whereas variables declared with the var keyword used to define a variable globally, or locally to an entire function regardless of block scope.Let's take an example to demonstrate the usage,javascript let counter = 30; if (counter === 30) { let counter = 31; console.log(counter); \/\/ 31 } console.log(counter); \/\/ 30 (because the variable in if block won't exist here)"},{"question":"What is the difference between let and var","answer":"You can list prohibited the divergence in a tabular format| var | let | | ----------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------- | | It is been available from the beginning of JavaScript | Introduced as part of ES6 | | It has function scope | It has block scope | | Variables will be hoisted | Hoisted but not initialized |Let's take an example to see the difference,javascript function userDetails(username) { if (username) { console.log(salary); \/\/ undefined due to hoisting console.log(age); \/\/ ReferenceError: Cannot access 'age' before initialization let age = 30; var salary = 10000; } console.log(salary); \/\/10000 (accessible due to function scope) console.log(age); \/\/error: age is not defined(due to block scope) } userDetails(\"John\");"},{"question":"What is the reason to choose the name let as a keyword","answer":"get is a mathematical statement that was adopted by early programming languages like Scheme and Basic. It has been borrowed from dozens of other languages that use let already as a traditional keyword as close to var as possible."},{"question":"How come you redeclare variable_star in switch block without an error","answer":"If you try to redeclare variables in a switch block then it will cause errors because there is only one block. For\nexample, the below code block throws a syntax error as below,```javascript\nlet counter = 1;\nswitch (x) {\n  case 0:\n    let name;\n    break;case 1:\n    let name; \/\/ SyntaxError for redeclaration.\n    break;\n}\n```To avoid this error, you can create a nested block inside a case clause and create a new block scoped lexical\nenvironment.javascript\nlet counter = 1;\nswitch (x) {\n  case 0: {\n    let name;\n    break;\n  }\n  case 1: {\n    let name; \/\/ No SyntaxError for redeclaration.\n    break;\n  }\n}"},{"question":"What is the Temporal utterly Zone","answer":"The Temporal Dead Zone is a behavior in JavaScript that occurs when declaring a variable with the let and const\nkeywords, but not with var. In ECMAScript 6, accessing a let or const variable before its declaration (within\nits scope) causes a ReferenceError. The time span when that happens, between the creation of a variable\u2019s binding\nand its declaration, is called the temporal dead zone.Let's see this behavior with an example,javascript\nfunction somemethod() {\n  console.log(counter1); \/\/ undefined\n  console.log(counter2); \/\/ ReferenceError\n  var counter1 = 1;\n  let counter2 = 2;\n}"},{"question":"What is IIFE(Immediately Invoked procedure Expression)","answer":"IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression) is a JavaScript function that runs as soon as it is defined.

Each time a memoized function is called, its parameters are used to index the cache. If the data is present, then it can be returned, without executing the entire function. Otherwise the function is executed and then the result is added to the cache. Let's take an example of adding function with memoization,javascript const memoizAddition = () => { let cache = {}; return (value) => { if (value in cache) { console.log(\"Fetching from cache\"); return cache[value]; \/\/ Here, cache.value cannot be used as property name starts with the number which is not a valid JavaScript identifier.

A new object is created that has an exact copy of the values in the original object. If any of the fields of the object are references to other objects, just the reference addresses are copied i.e., only the memory address is copied.Examplejavascript var empDetails = { name: \"John\", age: 25, expertise: \"Software Developer\", };to create a duplicatejavascript var empDetailsShallowCopy = empDetails; \/\/Shallow copying!if we change some property value in the duplicate one like this:javascript empDetailsShallowCopy.name = \"Johnson\";The above statement will also change the name of empDetails, since we have a shallow copy. That means we're losing the original data as well.Deep copy: A deep copy copies all fields, and makes copies of dynamically allocated memory pointed to by the fields. A deep copy occurs when an object is copied along with the objects to which it refers.Examplejavascript var empDetails = { name: \"John\", age: 25, expertise: \"Software Developer\", };Create a deep copy by using the properties from the original object into new variablejavascript var empDetailsDeepCopy = { name: empDetails.name, age: empDetails.age, expertise: empDetails.expertise, };Now if you change empDetailsDeepCopy.name, it will only affect empDetailsDeepCopy & not empDetails"},{"question":"How do you create specific number of copies of a string","answer":"The repeat() method constitute employ to construct and return a new string which contains the specified number of copies of the string on which it was called, concatenated together.

In JavaScript we can only inherit from a single object. ie. There can be only one [[prototype]] for an object.But sometimes we require to extend more than one, to overcome this we can use Mixin which helps to copy methods to the prototype of another class.Say for instance, we've two classes User and CleanRoom. Suppose we need to add CleanRoom functionality to User, so that user can clean the room at demand. Here's where concept called mixins comes into picture.``javascript \/\/ mixin let cleanRoomMixin = { cleanRoom() { alert(Hello ${this.name}, your room is clean now); }, sayBye() { alert(Bye ${this.name}`); }, };\/\/ usage: class User { constructor(name) { this.name = name; } }\/\/ copy the methods Object.assign(User.prototype, cleanRoomMixin);\/\/ now User can clean the room new User(\"Dude\").cleanRoom(); \/\/ Hello Dude, your room is clean now! ```"},{"question":"What is a thunk function","answer":"A thunk is barely a operate which delays the evaluation of the value.

You can fix this problem in different ways, Add catch block at the end of each chain: You can add catch block to the end of each of your promise chains javascript Promise.resolve(\"promised value\") .then(function () { throw new Error(\"error\"); }) .catch(function (error) { console.error(error.stack); });But it is quite difficult to type for each promise chain and verbose too. Add done method: You can replace first solution's then and catch blocks with done method javascript Promise.resolve(\"promised value\").done(function () { throw new Error(\"error\"); });Let's say you want to fetch data using HTTP and later perform processing on the resulting data asynchronously. You can write done block as below,javascript getDataFromHttp() .then(function (result) { return processDataAsync(result); }) .done(function (processed) { displayData(processed); });In future, if the processing library API changed to synchronous then you can remove done block as below,javascript getDataFromHttp().then(function (result) { return displayData(processDataAsync(result)); });and then you forgot to add done block to then block leads to silent errors. Extend ES6 Promises by Bluebird: Bluebird extends the ES6 Promises API to avoid the issue in the second solution. This library has a \u201cdefault\u201d onRejection handler which will print all errors from rejected Promises to stderr.

But the statement let x = y = 0 declares a local variable x. Whereas y declared as a global variable accidentally. This statement is equivalent to,javascript let x; window.y = 0; x = window.y;Since the block scoped variable x is undefined outside of the function, the type will be undefined too. Whereas the global variable y is available outside the function, the value is 0 and type is number.3.

The order of statements follows the below order, At first, the main function is pushed to the stack. Then the browser pushes the first statement of the main function( i.e, A's console.log) to the stack, executing and popping out immediately. But setTimeout statement moved to Browser API to apply the delay for callback. In the meantime, C's console.log added to stack, executed and popped out. The callback of setTimeout moved from Browser API to message queue. The main function popped out from stack because there are no statements to execute The callback moved from message queue to the stack since the stack is empty. The console.log for B is added to the stack and display on the console. 4. What is the output of below equality checkjavascript console.log(0.1 + 0.2 === 0.3); 1: false 2: true Answer: 1This is due to the float point math problem.

So it always returns true. Since it is not declared(or assigned) anywhere, f is undefined and typeof f is undefined too. In other words, it is same asjavascript var y = 1; if (\"foo\") { y += typeof f; } console.log(y);Note: It returns 1object for MS Edge browser6. What is the output of below codejavascript function foo() { return; { message: \"Hello World\"; } } console.log(foo()); 1: Hello World 2: Object {message: \"Hello World\"} 3: Undefined 4: SyntaxError Answer: 3This is a semicolon issue. Normally semicolons are optional in JavaScript. So if there are any statements(in this case, return) missing semicolon, it is automatically inserted immediately. Hence, the function returned as undefined.Whereas if the opening curly brace is along with the return keyword then the function is going to be returned as expected.javascript function foo() { return { message: \"Hello World\", }; } console.log(foo()); \/\/ {message: \"Hello World\"}7.

So the number or elements or length of the array won't be changed. If you try to print myChars then you can observe that it doesn't set an undefined value, rather the property is removed from the array. The newer versions of Chrome use empty instead of undefined to make the difference a bit clearer.8.

The above code snippet has duplicate parameters on 1st and 3rd parameters. The value of the first parameter is mapped to the third argument which is passed to the function. Hence, the 3rd argument overrides the first parameter.Note: In strict mode, duplicate parameters will throw a Syntax Error.12.

So you can see SyntaxError in the console.13. What is the output of below codejavascript const arrowFunc = () => arguments.length; console.log(arrowFunc(1, 2, 3)); 1: ReferenceError: arguments is not defined 2: 3 3: undefined 4: null Answer: 1Arrow functions do not have an arguments, super, this, or new.target bindings. So any reference to arguments variable tries to resolve to a binding in a lexically enclosing environment. In this case, the arguments variable is not defined outside of the arrow function. Hence, you will receive a reference error.Where as the normal function provides the number of arguments passed to the functionjavascript const func = function () { return arguments.length; }; console.log(func(1, 2, 3));But If you still want to use an arrow function then rest operator on arguments provides the expected argumentsjavascript const arrowFunc = (...args) => args.length; console.log(arrowFunc(1, 2, 3));14. What is the output of below codejavascript console.log(String.prototype.trimLeft.name === \"trimLeft\"); console.log(String.prototype.trimLeft.name === \"trimStart\"); 1: True, False 2: False, True Answer: 2In order to be consistent with functions like String.prototype.padStart, the standard method name for trimming the whitespaces is considered as trimStart. Due to web web compatibility reasons, the old method name 'trimLeft' still acts as an alias for 'trimStart'. Hence, the prototype for 'trimLeft' is always 'trimStart'15. What is the output of below codejavascript console.log(Math.max()); 1: undefined 2: Infinity 3: 0 4: -Infinity Answer: 4-Infinity is the initial comparant because almost every other value is bigger. So when no arguments are provided, -Infinity is going to be returned. Note: Zero number of arguments is a valid case.16. What is the output of below codejavascript console.log(10 == [10]); console.log(10 == [[[[[[[10]]]]]]]); 1: True, True 2: True, False 3: False, False 4: False, True Answer: 1As per the comparison algorithm in the ECMAScript specification(ECMA-262), the above expression converted into JS as belowjavascript 10 === Number([10].valueOf().toString()); \/\/ 10So it doesn't matter about number brackets([]) around the number, it is always converted to a number in the expression.17.

So if any operand is string type then both operands concatenated as strings. Whereas subtract(-) operator tries to convert the operands as number type.18. What is the output of below codejavascript console.log([0] == false); if ([0]) { console.log(\"I'm True\"); } else { console.log(\"I'm False\"); } 1: True, I'm True 2: True, I'm False 3: False, I'm True 4: False, I'm False Answer: 1In comparison operators, the expression [0] converted to Number([0].valueOf().toString()) which is resolved to false. Whereas [0] just becomes a truthy value without any conversion because there is no comparison operator.19. What is the output of below codejavascript console.log([1, 2] + [3, 4]); 1: [1,2,3,4] 2: [1,2][3,4] 3: SyntaxError 4: 1,23,4 Answer: 4The + operator is not meant or defined for arrays. So it converts arrays into strings and concatenates them.20.

At the same time, it is case sensitive data structure.21. What is the output of below codejavascript console.log(NaN === NaN); 1: True 2: False Answer: 2JavaScript follows IEEE 754 spec standards. As per this spec, NaNs are never equal for floating-point numbers.22. What is the output of below codejavascript let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, NaN]; console.log(numbers.indexOf(NaN)); 1: 4 2: NaN 3: SyntaxError 4: -1 Answer: 4The indexOf uses strict equality operator(===) internally and NaN === NaN evaluates to false. Since indexOf won't be able to find NaN inside an array, it returns -1 always. But you can use Array.prototype.findIndex method to find out the index of NaN in an array or You can use Array.prototype.includes to check if NaN is present in an array or not.```javascript let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, NaN]; console.log(numbers.findIndex(Number.isNaN)); \/\/ 4console.log(numbers.includes(NaN)); \/\/ true ```23. What is the output of below codejavascript let [a, ...b,] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]; console.log(a, b); 1: 1, [2, 3, 4, 5] 2: 1, {2, 3, 4, 5} 3: SyntaxError 4: 1, [2, 3, 4] Answer: 3When using rest parameters, trailing commas are not allowed and will throw a SyntaxError. If you remove the trailing comma then it displays 1st answerjavascript let [a, ...b] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]; console.log(a, b); \/\/ 1, [2, 3, 4, 5]25. What is the output of below codejavascript async function func() { return 10; } console.log(func()); 1: Promise {\\<fulfilled>: 10} 2: 10 3: SyntaxError 4: Promise {\\<rejected>: 10} Answer: 1Async functions always return a promise. But even if the return value of an async function is not explicitly a promise, it will be implicitly wrapped in a promise. The above async function is equivalent to below expression,javascript function func() { return Promise.resolve(10); }26. What is the output of below codejavascript async function func() { await 10; } console.log(func()); 1: Promise {\\<fulfilled>: 10} 2: 10 3: SyntaxError 4: Promise {\\<resolved>: undefined} Answer: 4The await expression returns value 10 with promise resolution and the code after each await expression can be treated as existing in a .then callback. In this case, there is no return expression at the end of the function. Hence, the default return value of undefined is returned as the resolution of the promise. The above async function is equivalent to below expression,javascript function func() { return Promise.resolve(10).then(() => undefined); }27. What is the output of below code```javascript function delay() { return new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 2000)); }async function delayedLog(item) { await delay(); console.log(item); }async function processArray(array) { array.forEach(item => { await delayedLog(item); }) }processArray([1, 2, 3, 4]); ``` 1: SyntaxError 2: 1, 2, 3, 4 3: 4, 4, 4, 4 4: 4, 3, 2, 1 Answer: 1Even though \u201cprocessArray\u201d is an async function, the anonymous function that we use for forEach is synchronous. If you use await inside a synchronous function then it throws a syntax error.28. What is the output of below code```javascript function delay() { return new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, 2000)); }async function delayedLog(item) { await delay(); console.log(item); }async function process(array) { array.forEach(async (item) => { await delayedLog(item); }); console.log(\"Process completed!\"); } process([1, 2, 3, 5]); ``` 1: 1 2 3 5 and Process completed! 2: 5 5 5 5 and Process completed! 3: Process completed! and 5 5 5 5 4: Process completed! and 1 2 3 5 Answer: 4The forEach method will not wait until all items are finished but it just runs the tasks and goes next. Hence, the last statement is displayed first followed by a sequence of promise resolutions.But you control the array sequence using for..of loop,javascript async function processArray(array) { for (const item of array) { await delayedLog(item); } console.log(\"Process completed!\"); }29. What is the output of below codejavascript var set = new Set(); set.add(\"+0\").add(\"-0\").add(NaN).add(undefined).add(NaN); console.log(set); 1: Set(4) {\"+0\", \"-0\", NaN, undefined} 2: Set(3) {\"+0\", NaN, undefined} 3: Set(5) {\"+0\", \"-0\", NaN, undefined, NaN} 4: Set(4) {\"+0\", NaN, undefined, NaN} Answer: 1Set has few exceptions from equality check, All NaN values are equal Both +0 and -0 considered as different values 30. What is the output of below code```javascript const sym1 = Symbol(\"one\"); const sym2 = Symbol(\"one\");const sym3 = Symbol.for(\"two\"); const sym4 = Symbol.for(\"two\");console.log(sym1 === sym2, sym3 === sym4); ``` 1: true, true 2: true, false 3: false, true 4: false, false Answer: 3Symbol follows below conventions, Every symbol value returned from Symbol() is unique irrespective of the optional string. Symbol.for() function creates a symbol in a global symbol registry list. But it doesn't necessarily create a new symbol on every call, it checks first if a symbol with the given key is already present in the registry and returns the symbol if it is found. Otherwise a new symbol created in the registry. Note: The symbol description is just useful for debugging purposes.31. What is the output of below codejavascript const sym1 = new Symbol(\"one\"); console.log(sym1); 1: SyntaxError 2: one 3: Symbol('one') 4: Symbol Answer: 1Symbol is a just a standard function and not an object constructor(unlike other primitives new Boolean, new String and new Number). So if you try to call it with the new operator will result in a TypeError32. What is the output of below code```javascript let myNumber = 100; let myString = \"100\";if (!typeof myNumber === \"string\") { console.log(\"It is not a string!\"); } else { console.log(\"It is a string!\"); }if (!typeof myString === \"number\") { console.log(\"It is not a number!\"); } else { console.log(\"It is a number!\"); } ``` 1: SyntaxError 2: It is not a string!, It is not a number! 3: It is not a string!, It is a number! 4: It is a string!, It is a number! Answer: 4The return value of typeof myNumber or typeof myString is always a truthy value (either \"number\" or \"string\"). The ! operator operates on either typeof myNumber or typeof myString, converting them to boolean values. Since the value of both !typeof myNumber and !typeof myString is false, the if condition fails, and control goes to else block.To make the ! operator operate on the equality expression, one needs to add parentheses:if (!(typeof myNumber === \"string\"))Or simply use the inequality operator:if (typeof myNumber !== \"string\")33. What is the output of below codejavascript console.log( JSON.stringify({ myArray: [\"one\", undefined, function () {}, Symbol(\"\")] }) ); console.log( JSON.stringify({ [Symbol.for(\"one\")]: \"one\" }, [Symbol.for(\"one\")]) ); 1: {\"myArray\":['one', undefined, {}, Symbol]}, {} 2: {\"myArray\":['one', null,null,null]}, {} 3: {\"myArray\":['one', null,null,null]}, \"{ [Symbol.for('one')]: 'one' }, [Symbol.for('one')]\" 4: {\"myArray\":['one', undefined, function(){}, Symbol('')]}, {} Answer: 2The symbols has below constraints, The undefined, Functions, and Symbols are not valid JSON values. So those values are either omitted (in an object) or changed to null (in an array). Hence, it returns null values for the value array. All Symbol-keyed properties will be completely ignored. Hence it returns an empty object({}). 34. What is the output of below code```javascript class A { constructor() { console.log(new.target.name); } }class B extends A { constructor() { super(); } }new A(); new B(); ``` 1: A, A 2: A, B Answer: 2Using constructors, new.target refers to the constructor (points to the class definition of class which is initialized) that was directly invoked by new. This also applies to the case if the constructor is in a parent class and was delegated from a child constructor.35. What is the output of below codejavascript const [x, ...y, z] = [1, 2, 3, 4]; console.log(x, y, z); 1: 1, [2, 3], 4 2: 1, [2, 3, 4], undefined 3: 1, [2], 3 4: SyntaxError Answer: 4It throws a syntax error because the rest element should not have a trailing comma. You should always consider using a rest operator as the last element.36. What is the output of below code```javascript const { a: x = 10, b: y = 20 } = { a: 30 };console.log(x); console.log(y); ``` 1: 30, 20 2: 10, 20 3: 10, undefined 4: 30, undefined Answer: 1The object property follows below rules, The object properties can be retrieved and assigned to a variable with a different name The property assigned a default value when the retrieved value is undefined 37. What is the output of below code```javascript function area({ length = 10, width = 20 }) { console.log(length * width); }area(); ``` 1: 200 2: Error 3: undefined 4: 0 Answer: 2If you leave out the right-hand side assignment for the destructuring object, the function will look for at least one argument to be supplied when invoked. Otherwise you will receive an error Error: Cannot read property 'length' of undefined as mentioned above.You can avoid the error with either of the below changes, Pass at least an empty object: ```javascript function area({ length = 10, width = 20 }) { console.log(length * width); }area({}); ``` Assign default empty object: ```javascript function area({ length = 10, width = 20 } = {}) { console.log(length * width); }area(); ```38. What is the output of below code```javascript const props = [ { id: 1, name: \"John\" }, { id: 2, name: \"Jack\" }, { id: 3, name: \"Tom\" }, ];const [, , { name }] = props; console.log(name); ``` 1: Tom 2: Error 3: undefined 4: John Answer: 1It is possible to combine Array and Object destructuring. In this case, the third element in the array props accessed first followed by name property in the object.39. What is the output of below code```javascript function checkType(num = 1) { console.log(typeof num); }checkType(); checkType(undefined); checkType(\"\"); checkType(null); ``` 1: number, undefined, string, object 2: undefined, undefined, string, object 3: number, number, string, object 4: number, number, number, number Answer: 3If the function argument is set implicitly(not passing argument) or explicitly to undefined, the value of the argument is the default parameter. Whereas for other falsy values('' or null), the value of the argument is passed as a parameter.Hence, the result of function calls categorized as below, The first two function calls logs number type since the type of default value is number The type of '' and null values are string and object type respectively. 40. What is the output of below code```javascript function add(item, items = []) { items.push(item); return items; }console.log(add(\"Orange\")); console.log(add(\"Apple\")); ``` 1: ['Orange'], ['Orange', 'Apple'] 2: ['Orange'], ['Apple'] Answer: 2Since the default argument is evaluated at call time, a new object is created each time the function is called. So in this case, the new array is created and an element pushed to the default empty array.41. What is the output of below code```javascript function greet(greeting, name, message = greeting + \" \" + name) { console.log([greeting, name, message]); }greet(\"Hello\", \"John\"); greet(\"Hello\", \"John\", \"Good morning!\"); ``` 1: SyntaxError 2: ['Hello', 'John', 'Hello John'], ['Hello', 'John', 'Good morning!'] Answer: 2Since parameters defined earlier are available to later default parameters, this code snippet doesn't throw any error.42. What is the output of below codejavascript function outer(f = inner()) { function inner() { return \"Inner\"; } } outer(); 1: ReferenceError 2: Inner Answer: 1The functions and variables declared in the function body cannot be referred from default value parameter initializers. If you still try to access, it throws a run-time ReferenceError(i.e, inner is not defined).43. What is the output of below code```javascript function myFun(x, y, ...manyMoreArgs) { console.log(manyMoreArgs); }myFun(1, 2, 3, 4, 5); myFun(1, 2); ``` 1: [3, 4, 5], undefined 2: SyntaxError 3: [3, 4, 5], [] 4: [3, 4, 5], [undefined] Answer: 3The rest parameter is used to hold the remaining parameters of a function and it becomes an empty array if the argument is not provided.44. What is the output of below codejavascript const obj = { key: \"value\" }; const array = [...obj]; console.log(array); 1: ['key', 'value'] 2: TypeError 3: [] 4: ['key'] Answer: 2Spread syntax can be applied only to iterable objects. By default, Objects are not iterable, but they become iterable when used in an Array, or with iterating functions such as map(), reduce(), and assign(). If you still try to do it, it still throws TypeError: obj is not iterable.45. What is the output of below codejavascript function* myGenFunc() { yield 1; yield 2; yield 3; } var myGenObj = new myGenFunc(); console.log(myGenObj.next().value); 1: 1 2: undefined 3: SyntaxError 4: TypeError Answer: 4Generators are not constructible type. But if you still proceed to do, there will be an error saying \"TypeError: myGenFunc is not a constructor\"46. What is the output of below code```javascript function* yieldAndReturn() { yield 1; return 2; yield 3; }var myGenObj = yieldAndReturn(); console.log(myGenObj.next()); console.log(myGenObj.next()); console.log(myGenObj.next()); ``` 1: { value: 1, done: false }, { value: 2, done: true }, { value: undefined, done: true } 2: { value: 1, done: false }, { value: 2, done: false }, { value: undefined, done: true } 3: { value: 1, done: false }, { value: 2, done: true }, { value: 3, done: true } 4: { value: 1, done: false }, { value: 2, done: false }, { value: 3, done: true } Answer: 1A return statement in a generator function will make the generator finish. If a value is returned, it will be set as the value property of the object and done property to true. When a generator is finished, subsequent next() calls return an object of this form: {value: undefined, done: true}.47. What is the output of below code```javascript const myGenerator = (function* () { yield 1; yield 2; yield 3; })(); for (const value of myGenerator) { console.log(value); break; }for (const value of myGenerator) { console.log(value); } ``` 1: 1,2,3 and 1,2,3 2: 1,2,3 and 4,5,6 3: 1 and 1 4: 1 Answer: 4The generator should not be re-used once the iterator is closed. i.e, Upon exiting a loop(on completion or using break & return), the generator is closed and trying to iterate over it again does not yield any more results. Hence, the second loop doesn't print any value.48. What is the output of below codejavascript const num = 0o38; console.log(num); 1: SyntaxError 2: 38 Answer: 1If you use an invalid number(outside of 0-7 range) in the octal literal, JavaScript will throw a SyntaxError. In ES5, it treats the octal literal as a decimal number.49. What is the output of below code```javascript const squareObj = new Square(10); console.log(squareObj.area);class Square { constructor(length) { this.length = length; }get area() { return this.length * this.length; }set area(value) { this.area = value; } } ``` 1: 100 2: ReferenceError Answer: 2Unlike function declarations, class declarations are not hoisted. i.e, First You need to declare your class and then access it, otherwise it will throw a ReferenceError \"Uncaught ReferenceError: Square is not defined\".Note: Class expressions also applies to the same hoisting restrictions of class declarations.50. What is the output of below code```javascript function Person() {}Person.prototype.walk = function () { return this; };Person.run = function () { return this; };let user = new Person(); let walk = user.walk; console.log(walk());let run = Person.run; console.log(run()); ``` 1: undefined, undefined 2: Person, Person 3: SyntaxError 4: Window, Window Answer: 4When a regular or prototype method is called without a value for this, the methods return an initial this value if the value is not undefined. Otherwise global window object will be returned. In our case, the initial this value is undefined so both methods return window objects.51. What is the output of below code```javascript class Vehicle { constructor(name) { this.name = name; }start() { console.log(${this.name} vehicle started); } }class Car extends Vehicle { start() { console.log(${this.name} car started); super.start(); } }const car = new Car(\"BMW\"); console.log(car.start()); ``` 1: SyntaxError 2: BMW vehicle started, BMW car started 3: BMW car started, BMW vehicle started 4: BMW car started, BMW car started Answer: 3The super keyword is used to call methods of a superclass. Unlike other languages the super invocation doesn't need to be a first statement. i.e, The statements will be executed in the same order of code.52. What is the output of below codejavascript const USER = { age: 30 }; USER.age = 25; console.log(USER.age); 1: 30 2: 25 3: Uncaught TypeError 4: SyntaxError Answer: 2Even though we used constant variables, the content of it is an object and the object's contents (e.g properties) can be altered. Hence, the change is going to be valid in this case.53. What is the output of below codejavascript console.log(\"\ud83d\ude42\" === \"\ud83d\ude42\"); 1: false 2: true Answer: 2Emojis are unicodes and the unicode for smile symbol is \"U+1F642\". The unicode comparision of same emojies is equivalent to string comparison. Hence, the output is always true.54. What is the output of below code?javascript console.log(typeof typeof typeof true); 1: string 2: boolean 3: NaN 4: number Answer: 1The typeof operator on any primitive returns a string value. So even if you apply the chain of typeof operators on the return value, it is always string.55. What is the output of below code?```javascript let zero = new Number(0);if (zero) { console.log(\"If\"); } else { console.log(\"Else\"); } ``` 1: If 2: Else 3: NaN 4: SyntaxError Answer: 1 The type of operator on new Number always returns object. i.e, typeof new Number(0) --> object. Objects are always truthy in if block Hence the above code block always goes to if section.55. What is the output of below code in non strict mode?```javascript let msg = \"Good morning!!\";msg.name = \"John\";console.log(msg.name); ``` 1: \"\" 2: Error 3: John 4: Undefined Answer: 4It returns undefined for non-strict mode and returns Error for strict mode. In non-strict mode, the wrapper object is going to be created and get the mentioned property. But the object get disappeared after accessing the property in next line.56. What is the output of below code?```javascript let count = 10;(function innerFunc() { if (count === 10) { let count = 11; console.log(count); } console.log(count); })(); ``` 1: 11, 10 2: 11, 11 3: 10, 11 4: 10, 10 Answer: 111 and 10 is logged to the console.The innerFunc is a closure which captures the count variable from the outerscope. i.e, 10. But the conditional has another local variable count which overwrites the ourter count variable. So the first console.log displays value 11. Whereas the second console.log logs 10 by capturing the count variable from outerscope.57. What is the output of below code ? 1: console.log(true && 'hi'); 2: console.log(true && 'hi' && 1); 3: console.log(true && '' && 0); Answer: 1: hi 2: 1 3: '' Reason : The operator returns the value of the first falsy operand encountered when evaluating from left to right, or the value of the last operand if they are all truthy.Note: Below these values are consider as falsy value 1: 0 2: '' 3: null 4: undefined 5: NAN 58. What is the output of below code ?```javascript let arr = [1, 2, 3]; let str = \"1,2,3\";console.log(arr == str); ``` 1: false 2: Error 3: true Answer: 3Arrays have their own implementation of toString method that returns a comma-separated list of elements. So the above code snippet returns true. In order to avoid conversion of array type, we should use === for comparison.59. What is the output of below code?```javascript getMessage();var getMessage = () => { console.log(\"Good morning\"); }; ``` 1: Good morning 2: getMessage is not a function 3: getMessage is not defined 4: Undefined Answer: 2Hoisting will move variables and functions to be the top of scope. Even though getMessage is an arrow function the above function will considered as a varible due to it's variable declaration or assignment. So the variables will have undefined value in memory phase and throws an error 'getMessage is not a function' at the code execution phase.60. What is the output of below code?```javascript let quickPromise = Promise.resolve();quickPromise.then(() => console.log(\"promise finished\"));console.log(\"program finished\"); ``` 1: program finished 2: Cannot predict the order 3: program finished, promise finished 4: promise finished, program finished Answer: 3Even though a promise is resolved immediately, it won't be executed immediately because its .then\/catch\/finally handlers or callbacks(aka task) are pushed into the queue. Whenever the JavaScript engine becomes free from the current program, it pulls a task from the queue and executes it. This is the reason why last statement is printed first before the log of promise handler.Note: We call the above queue as \"MicroTask Queue\"61. What is the output of below code?javascript console.log('First line') ['a', 'b', 'c'].forEach((element) => console.log(element)) console.log('Third line') 1: First line, then print a, b, c in a new line, and finally print Third line as next line 2: First line, then print a, b, c in a first line, and print Third line as next line 3: Missing semi-colon error 4: Cannot read properties of undefined Answer: 4When JavaScript encounters a line break without a semicolon, the JavaScript parser will automatically add a semicolon based on a set of rules called Automatic Semicolon Insertion which determines whether line break as end of statement or not to insert semicolon. But it does not assume a semicolon before square brackets [...]. So the first two lines considered as a single statement as below.javascript console.log('First line')['a', 'b', 'c'].forEach((element) => console.log(element))Hence, there will be cannot read properties of undefined error while applying the array square bracket on log function.62. Write a function that returns a random HEX colorSolution 1 (Iterative generation) ```javascript const HEX_ALPHABET = [\"0\", \"1\", \"2\", \"3\", \"4\", \"5\", \"6\", \"7\", \"8\", \"9\", \"a\", \"b\", \"c\", \"d\", \"e\", \"f\"]; const HEX_PREFIX = \"#\"; const HEX_LENGTH = 6; function generateRandomHex() { let randomHex = \"\"; for(let i = 0; i < HEX_LENGTH; i++) { const randomIndex = Math.floor(Math.random() * HEX_ALPHABET.length); randomHex += HEX_ALPHABET[randomIndex]; } return HEX_PREFIX + randomHex; } ``` Solution 2 (One-liner) ```javascript const HEX_PREFIX = \"#\"; const HEX_RADIX = 16; const HEX_LENGTH = 6; function generateRandomHex() { return HEX_PREFIX + Math.floor(Math.random() * 0xffffff).toString(HEX_RADIX).padStart(HEX_LENGTH, \"0\"); } ``` --- #### 63. What is the output of below code? ```javascript var of = ['of']; for(var of of of) { console.log(of); } ``` - 1: of - 2: SyntaxError: Unexpected token of - 3: SyntaxError: Identifier 'of' has already been declared - 4: ReferenceError: of is not defined ##### Answer: 1 In JavaScript, `of` is not considered as a reserved keyword. So the variable declaration with `of` is accepted and prints the array value `of` using for..of loop. But if you use reserved keyword such as `in` then there will be a syntax error saying `SyntaxError: Unexpected token in`, ```javascript var in = ['in']; for(var in in in) { console.log(in[in]); } ``` --- #### 64. What is the output of below code? ```javascript const numbers = [11, 25, 31, 23, 33, 18, 200]; numbers.sort(); console.log(numbers); ``` - 1: [11, 18, 23, 25, 31, 33, 200] - 2: [11, 18, 200, 23, 25, 31, 33] - 3: [11, 25, 31, 23, 33, 18, 200] - 4: Cannot sort numbers ##### Answer: 2 By default, the sort method sorts elements alphabetically. This is because elemented converted to strings and strings compared in UTF-16 code units order. Hence, you will see the above numbers not sorted as expected. In order to sort numerically just supply a comparator function which handles numeric sorts. ```javascript const numbers = [11, 25, 31, 23, 33, 18, 200]; numbers.sort((a, b) => a - b); console.log(numbers); ``` **Note:** Sort() method changes the original array. --- #### 65. What is the output order of below code? ```javascript setTimeout(() => {console.log('1')}, 0); Promise.resolve('hello').then(() => console.log('2')); console.log('3'); ``` - 1: 1, 2, 3 - 2: 1, 3, 2 - 3: 3, 1, 2 - 4: 3, 2, 1 ##### Answer: 4 When the JavaScript engine parses the above code, the first two statements are asynchronous which will be executed later and third statement is synchronous statement which will be moved to callstack, executed and prints the number 3 in the console. Next, Promise is native in ES6 and it will be moved to Job queue which has high priority than callback queue in the execution order. At last, since setTimeout is part of WebAPI the callback function moved to callback queue and executed. Hence, you will see number 2 printed first followed by 1. --- #### 66. What is the output of below code? ```javascript console.log(name); console.log(message()); var name = 'John'; (function message() { console.log('Hello John: Welcome'); }); ``` - 1: John, Hello John: Welcome - 2: undefined, Hello John, Welcome - 3: Reference error: name is not defined, Reference error: message is not defined - 4: undefined, Reference error: message is not defined ##### Answer: 4 IIFE(Immediately Invoked Function Expression) is just like any other function expression which won't be hoisted. Hence, there will be a reference error for message call. The behavior would be the same with below function expression of message1, ```javascript console.log(name); console.log(message()); var name = 'John'; var message = function () { console.log('Hello John: Welcome'); }); ``` --- #### 67. What is the output of below code? ```javascript message() function message() { console.log(\"Hello\"); } function message() { console.log(\"Bye\"); } ``` - 1: Reference error: message is not defined - 2: Hello - 3: Bye - 4: Compile time error ##### Answer: 3 As part of hoisting, initially JavaScript Engine or compiler will store first function in heap memory but later rewrite or replaces with redefined function content. --- #### 68. What is the output of below code? ```javascript var currentCity = \"NewYork\"; var changeCurrentCity = function() { console.log('Current City:', currentCity); var currentCity = \"Singapore\"; console.log('Current City:', currentCity); } changeCurrentCity(); ``` - 1: NewYork, Singapore - 2: NewYork, NewYork - 3: undefined, Singapore - 4: Singapore, Singapore ##### Answer: 3 Due to hositing feature, the variables declared with `var` will have `undefined` value in the creation phase so the outer variable `currentCity` will get same `undefined` value. But after few lines of code JavaScript engine found a new function call(`changeCurrentCity()`) to update the current city with `var` re-declaration. Since each function call will create a new execution context, the same variable will have `undefined` value before the declaration and new value(`Singapore`) after the declarion. Hence, the value `undefined` print first followed by new value `Singapore` in the execution phase. --- #### 69. What is the output of below code in an order? ```javascript function second() { var message; console.log(message); } function first() { var message=\"first\"; second(); console.log(message); } var message = \"default\"; first(); console.log(message); ``` - 1: undefined, first, default - 2: default, default, default - 3: first, first, default - 4: undefined, undefined, undefined ##### Answer: 1 Each context(global or functional) has it's own variable environment and the callstack of variables in a LIFO order. So you can see the message variable value from second, first functions in an order followed by global context message variable value at the end. --- #### 70. What is the output of below code? ```javascript var expressionOne = function functionOne() { console.log(\"functionOne\"); } functionOne(); ``` - 1: functionOne is not defined - 2: functionOne - 3: console.log(\"functionOne\") - 4: undefined ##### Answer: 1 The function call `functionOne` is not going to be part of scope chain and it has it's own execution context with the enclosed variable environment. i.e, It won't be accessed from global context. Hence, there will be an error while invoking the function as `functionOne is not defined`. --- #### 71. What is the output of below code? ```javascript const user = { name: 'John', eat() { console.log(this); var eatFruit = function() { console.log(this); } eatFruit() } } user.eat(); ``` - 1: {name: \"John\", eat: f}, {name: \"John\", eat: f} - 2: Window {...}, Window {...} - 3: {name: \"John\", eat: f}, undefined - 4: {name: \"John\", eat: f}, Window {...} ##### Answer: 4 `this` keyword is dynamic scoped but not lexically scoped . In other words, it doesn't matter where `this` has been written but how it has been invoked really matter. In the above code snippet, the `user` object invokes `eat` function so `this` keyword refers to `user` object but `eatFruit` has been invoked by `eat` function and `this` will have default `Window` object. The above pit fall fixed by three ways, 1. In ES6, the arrow function will make `this` keyword as lexically scoped. Since the surrounding object of `this` object is `user` object, the `eatFruit` function will contain `user` object for `this` object. ```javascript const user = { name: 'John', eat() { console.log(this); var eatFruit = () => { console.log(this); } eatFruit() } } user.eat(); ``` The next two solutions have been used before ES6 introduced. 2. It is possible create a reference of `this` into a separate variable and use that new variable inplace of `this` keyword inside `eatFruit` function. This is a common practice in jQuery and AngularJS before ES6 introduced. ```javascript const user = { name: 'John', eat() { console.log(this); var self = this; var eatFruit = () => { console.log(self); } eatFruit() } } user.eat(); ``` 3. The `eatFruit` function can bind explicitly with `this` keyword where it refers `Window` object. ```javascript const user = { name: 'John', eat() { console.log(this); var eatFruit = function() { console.log(this); } return eatFruit.bind(this) } } user.eat()(); ``` --- #### 72. What is the output of below code? ```javascript let message = 'Hello World!'; message[0] = 'J'; console.log(message) let name = 'John'; name = name + ' Smith'; console.log(name); ``` - 1: Jello World!, John Smith - 2: Jello World!, John - 3: Hello World!, John Smith - 4: Hello World!, John ##### Answer: 3 In JavaScript, primitives are immutable i.e. there is no way to change a primitive value once it gets created. So when you try to update the string's first character, there is no change in the string value and prints the same initial value `Hello World!`. Whereas in the later example, the concatenated value is re-assigned to the same variable which will result into creation of new memory block with the reference pointing to `John Smith` value and the old memory block value(`John`) will be garbage collected. --- #### 73. What is the output of below code? ```javascript let user1 = { name : 'Jacob', age : 28 }; let user2 = { name : 'Jacob', age : 28 }; console.log(user1 === user2); ``` - 1: True - 2: False - 3: Compile time error ##### Answer: 2 In JavaScript, the variables such as objects, arrays and functions comes under pass by reference. When you try to compare two objects with same content, it is going to compare memory address or reference of those variables. These variables always create separate memory blocks hence the comparison is always going to return false value. --- #### 74. What is the output of below code? ```javascript function greeting() { setTimeout(function() { console.log(message); }, 5000); const message = \"Hello, Good morning\"; } greeting(); ``` - 1: Undefined - 2: Reference error: - 3: Hello, Good morning - 4: null ##### Answer: 3 The variable `message` is still treated as closure(since it has been used in inner function) eventhough it has been declared after setTimeout function. The function with in setTimeout function will be sent to WebAPI and the variable declaration executed with in 5 seconds with the assigned value. Hence, the text declared for the variable will be displayed. --- #### 75. What is the output of below code? ```javascript const a = new Number(10); const b = 10; console.log(a === b); ``` - 1: False - 2: True ##### Answer: 1 Eventhough both variables `a` and `b` refer a number value, the first declaration is based on constructor function and the type of the variable is going to be `object` type. Whereas the second declaration is primitive assignment with a number and the type is `number` type. Hence, the equality operator `===` will output `false` value. --- #### 76. What is the type of below function? ```javascript function add(a, b) { console.log(\"The input arguments are: \", a, b); return a + b; } ``` - 1: Pure function - 2: Impure function ##### Answer: 2 Eventhough the above function returns the same result for the same arguments(input) that are passed in the function, the `console.log()` statement causes a function to have side effects because it affects the state of an external code. i.e, the `console` object's state and depends on it to perform the job. Hence, the above function considered as impure function. --- #### 77. What is the output of below code? ```javascript const promiseOne = new Promise((resolve, reject) => setTimeout(resolve, 4000)); const promiseTwo = new Promise((resolve, reject) => setTimeout(reject, 4000)); Promise.all([promiseOne, promiseTwo]).then(data => console.log(data)); ``` - 1: [{status: \"fullfilled\", value: undefined}, {status: \"rejected\", reason: undefined}] - 2: [{status: \"fullfilled\", value: undefined}, Uncaught(in promise)] - 3: Uncaught (in promise) - 4: [Uncaught(in promise), Uncaught(in promise)] ##### Answer: 3 The above promises settled at the same time but one of them resolved and other one rejected. When you use `.all` method on these promises, the result will be short circuted by throwing an error due to rejection in second promise. But If you use `.allSettled` method then result of both the promises will be returned irrespective of resolved or rejected promise status without throwing any error. ```javascript Promise.allSettled([promiseOne, promiseTwo]).then(data => console.log(data)); ``` --- #### 78. What is the output of below code? ```javascript try { setTimeout(() => { console.log('try block'); throw new Error(`An exception is thrown`) }, 1000); } catch(err) { console.log('Error: ', err); } ``` - 1: try block, Error: An exception is thrown - 2: Error: An exception is thrown - 3: try block, Uncaught Error: Exception is thrown - 4: Uncaught Error: Exception is thrown ##### Answer: 3 If you put `setTimeout` and `setInterval` methods inside the try clause and an exception is thrown, the catch clause will not catch any of them. This is because the try...catch statement works synchronously, and the function in the above code is executed asynchronously after a certain period of time. Hence, you will see runtime exception without catching the error. To resolve this issue, you have to put the try...catch block inside the function as below, ```javascript setTimeout(() => { try { console.log('try block'); throw new Error(`An exception is thrown`) } catch(err) { console.log('Error: ', err); } }, 1000); ``` You can use `.catch()` function in promises to avoid these issues with asynchronous code."},{"question":"What is React?","answer":"React(aka React.js operating_theatre ReactJS) is an open-source front-end JavaScript library that is used for make composable user interfaces, especially for single-page applications. It is used for handling view layer for web and mobile apps based on components in a declarative approach. React was created by Jordan Walke, a software engineer working for Facebook. React was first deployed on Facebook's News Feed in 2011 and on Instagram in 2012."},{"question":"What is the history behind React evolution?","answer":"The chronicle of ReactJS started Hoosier_State 2010 with the creation of **XHP**. XHP is a PHP extension which improved the syntax of the language such that XML document fragments become valid PHP expressions and the primary purpose was used to create custom and reusable HTML elements. The main principle of this extension was to make front-end code easier to understand and to help avoid cross-site scripting attacks. The project was successful to prevent the malicious content submitted by the scrubbing user.But there was a different problem with XHP in which dynamic web applications require many roundtrips to the server, and XHP did not solve this problem. Also, the whole UI was re-rendered for small change in the application. Later, the initial prototype of React is created with the name FaxJ by Jordan inspired from XHP. Finally after sometime React has been introduced as a new library into JavaScript world.Note: JSX comes from the idea of XHP What are the major features of React? The major features of React are: Uses JSX syntax, a syntax extension of JS that allows developers to write HTML in their JS code. It uses Virtual DOM instead of Real DOM considering that Real DOM manipulations are expensive. Supports server-side rendering which is useful for Search Engine Optimizations(SEO). Follows Unidirectional or one-way data flow or data binding. Uses reusable\/composable UI components to develop the view. What is JSX? JSX stands for JavaScript XML and it is an XML-like syntax extension to ECMAScript. Basically it just provides the syntactic sugar for the React.createElement(type, props, ...children) function, giving us expressiveness of JavaScript along with HTML like template syntax.In the example below, the text inside <h1> tag is returned as JavaScript function to the render function.jsx harmony export default function App() { return ( <h1 className=\"greeting\">{\"Hello, this is a JSX Code!\"}<\/h1> ); } If you don't use JSX syntax then the respective JavaScript code should be written as below,```javascript import { createElement } from 'react';export default function App() { return createElement( 'h1', { className: 'greeting' }, 'Hello, this is a JSX Code!' ); } ```See Class jsx harmony class App extends React.Component { render() { return ( <h1 className=\"greeting\">{\"Hello, this is a JSX Code!\"}<\/h1> ); } } Note: JSX is stricter than HTML What is the difference between Element and Component? An Element is a plain object describing what you want to appear on the screen in terms of the DOM nodes or other components. Elements can contain other Elements in their props. Creating a React element is cheap. Once an element is created, it cannot be mutated.The JavaScript representation(Without JSX) of React Element would be as follows:javascript const element = React.createElement(\"div\", { id: \"login-btn\" }, \"Login\"); and this element can be simiplified using JSXhtml <div id=\"login-btn\">Login<\/div>The above React.createElement() function returns an object as below:{ type: 'div', props: { children: 'Login', id: 'login-btn' } }Finally, this element renders to the DOM using ReactDOM.render().Whereas a component can be declared in several different ways. It can be a class with a render() method or it can be defined as a function. In either case, it takes props as an input, and returns a JSX tree as the output:javascript const Button = ({ handleLogin }) => ( <div id={\"login-btn\"} onClick={handleLogin}> Login <\/div> );Then JSX gets transpiled to a React.createElement() function tree:javascript const Button = ({ handleLogin }) => React.createElement( \"div\", { id: \"login-btn\", onClick: handleLogin }, \"Login\" ); How to create components in React? Components are the building blocks of creating User Interfaces(UI) in React. There are two possible ways to create a component. Function Components: This is the simplest way to create a component. Those are pure JavaScript functions that accept props object as the first parameter and return React elements to render the output: jsx harmony function Greeting({ message }) { return <h1>{`Hello, ${message}`}<\/h1>; } Class Components: You can also use ES6 class to define a component. The above function component can be written as a class component: jsx harmony class Greeting extends React.Component { render() { return <h1>{`Hello, ${this.props.message}`}<\/h1>; } } When to use a Class Component over a Function Component? After the addition of Hooks(i.e. React 16.8 onwards) it is always recommended to use Function components over Class components in React. Because you could use state, lifecycle methods and other features that were only available in class component present in function component too. But even there are two reasons to use Class components over Function components. If you need a React functionality whose Function component equivalent is not present yet, like Error Boundaries. In older versions, If the component needs state or lifecycle methods then you need to use class component. Note: You can also use reusable react error boundary third-party component without writing any class. i.e, No need to use class components for Error boundaries.The usage of Error boundaries from the above library is quite straight forward.```jsx \"use client\";import { ErrorBoundary } from \"react-error-boundary\";Something went wrong\\}> ``` What are Pure Components? Pure components are the components which render the same output for the same state and props. In function components, you can achieve these pure components through memoized React.memo() API wrapping around the component. This API prevents unnecessary re-renders by comparing the previous props and new props using shallow comparison. So it will be helpful for performance optimizations. But at the same time, it won't compare the previous state with the current state because function component itself prevents the unnecessary rendering by default when you set the same state again.The syntactic representation of memoized components looks like below,jsx const MemoizedComponent = memo(SomeComponent, arePropsEqual?);Below is the example of how child component(i.e., EmployeeProfile) prevents re-renders for the same props passed by parent component(i.e.,EmployeeRegForm).```jsx import { memo, useState } from 'react';const EmployeeProfile = memo(function EmployeeProfile({ name, email }) { return (<> Name:{name} Email: {email} ); }); export default function EmployeeRegForm() { const [name, setName] = useState(''); const [email, setEmail] = useState(''); return ( <> Name: setName(e.target.value)} \/> Email: setEmail(e.target.value)} \/> ); } ``` In the above code, the email prop has not been passed to child component. So there won't be any re-renders for email prop change.In class components, the components extending React.PureComponent instead of React.Component become the pure components. When props or state changes, PureComponent will do a shallow comparison on both props and state by invoking shouldComponentUpdate() lifecycle method. Note: React.memo() is a higher-order component. What is state in React? State of a component is an object that holds some information that may change over the lifetime of the component. The important point is whenever the state object changes, the component re-renders. It is always recommended to make our state as simple as possible and minimize the number of stateful components.Let's take an example of User component with message state. Here, useState hook has been used to add state to the User component and it returns an array with current state and function to update it.```jsx harmony import React, { useState } from \"react\";function User() { const [message, setMessage] = useState(\"Welcome to React world\");return ( {message} ); } ```See Class ```jsx harmony import React from 'react'; class User extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props); this.state = { message: \"Welcome to React world\", }; } render() { return ( {this.state.message} ); } } ``` State is similar to props, but it is private and fully controlled by the component ,i.e., it is not accessible to any other component till the owner component decides to pass it. What are props in React? Props are inputs to components. They are single values or objects containing a set of values that are passed to components on creation similar to HTML-tag attributes. Here, the data is passed down from a parent component to a child component.The primary purpose of props in React is to provide following component functionality: Pass custom data to your component. Trigger state changes. Use via this.props.reactProp inside component's render() method. For example, let us create an element with reactProp property:jsx harmony <Element reactProp={\"1\"} \/>This reactProp (or whatever you came up with) attribute name then becomes a property attached to React's native props object which originally already exists on all components created using React library.jsx harmony props.reactPropFor example, the usage of props in function component looks like below:```jsx import React from \"react\"; import ReactDOM from \"react-dom\";const ChildComponent = (props) => { return ( {props.name} {props.age} ); };const ParentComponent = () => { return ( ); }; ```"},{"question":"How to produce ingredient in React?","answer":""},{"question":"When to use adenine Class ingredient over a Function Component?","answer":""},{"question":"What is state indium React?","answer":""},{"question":"What is the difference between state and props?","answer":"In React, both state and props cost quetch JavaScript objects and used to manage the data of a component, but they are used in different ways and have different characteristics. state is managed by the component itself and can be updated using the setState() function. Unlike props, state can be modified by the component and is used to manage the internal state of the component. Changes in the state trigger a re-render of the component and its children. props (short for \"properties\") are passed to a component by its parent component and are read-only, meaning that they cannot be modified by the component itself. props can be used to configure the behavior of a component and to pass data between components."},{"question":"What is the purpose of recall function atomic_number_33 an argument of setState()?","answer":"The callback function is invoked when setState finished and the component gets rendered.

(refer \"activateLasers\" function in the first point for example)"},{"question":"How to bind methods or event handlers in JSX callbacks?","answer":"There comprise 3 possible ways to achieve this in class components: Binding in Constructor: In JavaScript classes, the methods are not bound by default. The same rule applies for React event handlers defined as class methods. Normally we bind them in constructor. javascript class User extends Component { constructor(props) { super(props); this.handleClick = this.handleClick.bind(this); } handleClick() { console.log(\"SingOut triggered\"); } render() { return <button onClick={this.handleClick}>SingOut<\/button>; } } Public class fields syntax: If you don't like to use bind approach then public class fields syntax can be used to correctly bind callbacks. The Create React App eanables this syntax by default. jsx harmony handleClick = () => { console.log(\"SingOut triggered\", this); };jsx harmony <button onClick={this.handleClick}>SingOut<\/button> Arrow functions in callbacks: It is possible to use arrow functions directly in the callbacks. jsx harmony handleClick() { console.log('SingOut triggered'); } render() { return <button onClick={() => this.handleClick()}>SignOut<\/button>; }Note: If the callback is passed as prop to child components, those components might do an extra re-rendering. In those cases, it is preferred to go with .bind() or public class fields syntax approach considering performance."},{"question":"How to pass a parameter to an event handler or callback?","answer":"You can habituate an arrow function to wrap around an event handler and pass parameters:jsx harmony <button onClick={() => this.handleClick(id)} \/>This is an equivalent to calling .bind:jsx harmony <button onClick={this.handleClick.bind(this, id)} \/>Apart from these two approaches, you can also pass arguments to a function which is defined as arrow functionjsx harmony <button onClick={this.handleClick(id)} \/>; handleClick = (id) => () => { console.log(\"Hello, your ticket number is\", id); };"},{"question":"What are synthetic events in React?","answer":"SyntheticEvent is a cross-browser negligee some the browser's native event. Its API is same as the browser's native event, including stopPropagation() and preventDefault(), except the events work identically across all browsers. The native events can be accessed directly from synthetic events using nativeEvent attribute.Let's take an example of BookStore title search component with the ability to get all native event properties```js function BookStore() { handleTitleChange(e) { console.log('The new title is:', e.target.value); \/\/ 'e' represents synthetic event const nativeEvent = e.nativeEvent; console.log(nativeEvent); e.stopPropogation(); e.preventDefault(); }return } ```"},{"question":"What are inline conditional expressions?","answer":"You tin use either if statements or ternary expressions which are available from JS to conditionally render expressions. Apart from these approaches, you can also embed any expressions in JSX by wrapping them in curly braces and then followed by JS logical operator &&.jsx harmony <h1>Hello!<\/h1>; { messages.length > 0 && !isLogin ? ( <h2>You have {messages.length} unread messages.<\/h2> ) : ( <h2>You don't have unread messages.<\/h2> ); }"},{"question":"What is \"key\" prop and what is the benefit of using it in arrays of elements?","answer":"A key is a special impute you should include when creating arrays of elements. Key prop helps React identify which items have changed, are added, or are removed.Keys should be unique among its siblings. Most often we use ID from our data as key:jsx harmony const todoItems = todos.map((todo) => <li key={todo.id}>{todo.text}<\/li>);When you don't have stable IDs for rendered items, you may use the item index as a key as a last resort:jsx harmony const todoItems = todos.map((todo, index) => ( <li key={index}>{todo.text}<\/li> ));Note: Using indexes for keys is not recommended if the order of items may change. This can negatively impact performance and may cause issues with component state. If you extract list item as separate component then apply keys on list component instead of li tag. There will be a warning message in the console if the key prop is not present on list items. The key attribute accepts either string or number and internally convert it as string type."},{"question":"What is the use of refs?","answer":"The ref is apply to return a computer_address to the element. They should be avoided in most cases, however, they can be useful when you need a direct access to the DOM element or an instance of a component."},{"question":"How to create refs?","answer":"There are two draw_near This equal a recently added approach. Refs are created using React.createRef() method and attached to React elements via the ref attribute. In order to use refs throughout the component, just assign the ref to the instance property within constructor. jsx harmony class MyComponent extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props); this.myRef = React.createRef(); } render() { return <div ref={this.myRef} \/>; } } You can also use ref callbacks approach regardless of React version. For example, the search bar component's input element is accessed as follows, jsx harmony class SearchBar extends Component { constructor(props) { super(props); this.txtSearch = null; this.state = { term: \"\" }; this.setInputSearchRef = (e) => { this.txtSearch = e; }; } onInputChange(event) { this.setState({ term: this.txtSearch.value }); } render() { return ( <input value={this.state.term} onChange={this.onInputChange.bind(this)} ref={this.setInputSearchRef} \/> ); } } You can also use refs in function components using closures.

We advise against it because string refs have below issues, and are considered legacy. String refs were removed in React v16. They force React to keep track of currently executing component. This is problematic because it makes react module stateful, and thus causes weird errors when react module is duplicated in the bundle. They are not composable \u2014 if a library puts a ref on the passed child, the user can't put another ref on it. Callback refs are perfectly composable. They don't work with static analysis like Flow. Flow can't guess the magic that framework does to make the string ref appear on this.refs, as well as its type (which could be different). Callback refs are friendlier to static analysis. It doesn't work as most people would expect with the \"render callback\" pattern (e.g. ) ```jsx harmony class MyComponent extends Component { renderRow = (index) => { \/\/ This won't work. Ref will get attached to DataTable rather than MyComponent: return ; \/\/ This would work though! Callback refs are awesome. return <input ref={(input) => (this[\"input-\" + index] = input)} \/>; }; render() { return ( <DataTable data={this.props.data} renderRow={this.renderRow} \/> ); } } ```"},{"question":"What is Virtual DOM?","answer":"The Virtual DOM (VDOM) comprise an in-memory representation of actual DOM.

That means if two child components share the same data from its parent, then move the state to parent instead of maintaining local state in both of the child components."},{"question":"What are the different phases of component lifecycle?","answer":"The component lifecycle cause leash distinct lifecycle phases: Mounting: The component is ready to mount in the browser DOM. This phase covers initialization from constructor(), getDerivedStateFromProps(), render(), and componentDidMount() lifecycle methods. Updating: In this phase, the component gets updated in two ways, sending the new props and updating the state either from setState() or forceUpdate(). This phase covers getDerivedStateFromProps(), shouldComponentUpdate(), render(), getSnapshotBeforeUpdate() and componentDidUpdate() lifecycle methods. Unmounting: In this last phase, the component is not needed and gets unmounted from the browser DOM. This phase includes componentWillUnmount() lifecycle method. It's worth mentioning that React internally has a concept of phases when applying changes to the DOM. They are separated as follows Render The component will render without any side effects. This applies to Pure components and in this phase, React can pause, abort, or restart the render. Pre-commit Before the component actually applies the changes to the DOM, there is a moment that allows React to read from the DOM through the getSnapshotBeforeUpdate(). Commit React works with the DOM and executes the final lifecycles respectively componentDidMount() for mounting, componentDidUpdate() for updating, and componentWillUnmount() for unmounting.

By default it returns true. If you are sure that the component doesn't need to render after state or props are updated, you can return false value. It is a great place to improve performance as it allows you to prevent a re-render if component receives new prop. componentWillUpdate: Executed before re-rendering the component when there are props & state changes confirmed by shouldComponentUpdate() which returns true. componentDidUpdate: Mostly it is used to update the DOM in response to prop or state changes. componentWillUnmount: It will be used to cancel any outgoing network requests, or remove all event listeners associated with the component. React 16.3+ getDerivedStateFromProps: Invoked right before calling render() and is invoked on every render. This exists for rare use cases where you need a derived state.

This will not fire if shouldComponentUpdate() returns false. componentWillUnmount It will be used to cancel any outgoing network requests, or remove all event listeners associated with the component."},{"question":"What are Higher-Order Components?","answer":"A higher-order component (HOC) is ampere function that takes a factor and returns a new component. Basically, it's a pattern that is derived from React's compositional nature.We call them pure components because they can accept any dynamically provided child component but they won't modify or copy any behavior from their input components.javascript const EnhancedComponent = higherOrderComponent(WrappedComponent);HOC can be used for many use cases: Code reuse, logic and bootstrap abstraction. Render hijacking. State abstraction and manipulation. Props manipulation."},{"question":"How to create props proxy for HOC component?","answer":"You fundament add\/edit props passed to the component using property proxy pattern like this:```jsx harmony function HOC(WrappedComponent) { return class Test extends Component { render() { const newProps = { title: \"New Header\", footer: false, showFeatureX: false, showFeatureY: true, }; return <WrappedComponent {...this.props} {...newProps} \/>; } }; } ```"},{"question":"What is context?","answer":"Context provide ampere way to pass data through the component tree without having to pass props down manually at every level.For example, authenticated users, locale preferences, UI themes need to be accessed in the application by many components.javascript const { Provider, Consumer } = React.createContext(defaultValue);"},{"question":"What is children prop?","answer":"baby is a prop_up (this.props.children) that allows you to pass components as data to other components, just like any other prop you use. Component tree put between component's opening and closing tag will be passed to that component as children prop.There are several methods available in the React API to work with this prop. These include React.Children.map, React.Children.forEach, React.Children.count, React.Children.only, React.Children.toArray.A simple usage of children prop looks as below,```jsx harmony const MyDiv = React.createClass({ render: function () { return {this.props.children}; }, });ReactDOM.render( {\"Hello\"} {\"World\"} , node ); ```"},{"question":"How to write gloss in React?","answer":"The comments in React\/JSX are similar to JavaScript Multiline comments but are wrapped in curly braces.Single-line comments:jsx harmony\n<div>\n  {\/* Single-line comments(In vanilla JavaScript, the single-line comments are represented by double slash(\/\/)) *\/}\n  {`Welcome ${user}, let's play React`}\n<\/div>Multi-line comments:jsx harmony\n<div>\n  {\/* Multi-line comments for more than\n   one line *\/}\n  {`Welcome ${user}, let's play React`}\n<\/div>"},{"question":"What is the purpose of using super constructor with props argument?","answer":"A child course constructor cannot make use of this reference until the super() method has be called. The same applies to ES6 sub-classes as well. The main reason for passing props parameter to super() call is to access this.props in your child constructors.Passing props:```javascript class MyComponent extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props);console.log(this.props); \/\/ prints { name: 'John', age: 42 } } } ```Not passing props:```javascript class MyComponent extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super();console.log(this.props); \/\/ prints undefined \/\/ but props parameter is still available console.log(props); \/\/ prints { name: 'John', age: 42 } }render() { \/\/ no difference outside constructor console.log(this.props); \/\/ prints { name: 'John', age: 42 } } } ```The above code snippets reveals that this.props is different only within the constructor. It would be the same outside the constructor."},{"question":"What is reconciliation?","answer":"balancing exist the process through which React updates the Browser DOM and makes React work faster. React use a diffing algorithm so that component updates are predictable and faster. React would first calculate the difference between the real DOM and the copy of DOM (Virtual DOM) when there's an update of components. React stores a copy of Browser DOM which is called Virtual DOM. When we make changes or add data, React creates a new Virtual DOM and compares it with the previous one. This comparison is done by Diffing Algorithm. Now React compares the Virtual DOM with Real DOM. It finds out the changed nodes and updates only the changed nodes in Real DOM leaving the rest nodes as it is. This process is called Reconciliation."},{"question":"How to set state with a dynamic key name?","answer":"If you are using ES6 or the Babel transpiler to transform your JSX code then you can accomplish this with computed property names.javascript handleInputChange(event) { this.setState({ [event.target.id]: event.target.value }) }"},{"question":"What would be the common mistake of function being called every time the component renders?","answer":"You need to make sure that function is not constitute called while passing the function as a parameter.jsx harmony render() { \/\/ Wrong: handleClick is called instead of passed as a reference! return <button onClick={this.handleClick()}>{'Click Me'}<\/button> }Instead, pass the function itself without parenthesis:jsx harmony render() { \/\/ Correct: handleClick is passed as a reference! return <button onClick={this.handleClick}>{'Click Me'}<\/button> }"},{"question":"Is lazy subroutine endure named exports?","answer":"No, currently React.lazy function supports default exports only. If you would like to import modules which are named exports, you can create an intermediate module that reexports it as the default. It also ensures that tree shaking keeps working and don\u2019t pull unused components.\nLet's take a component file which exports multiple named components,javascript\n\/\/ MoreComponents.js\nexport const SomeComponent = \/* ... *\/;\nexport const UnusedComponent = \/* ... *\/;and reexport MoreComponents.js components in an intermediate file IntermediateComponent.jsjavascript\n\/\/ IntermediateComponent.js\nexport { SomeComponent as default } from \".\/MoreComponents.js\";Now you can import the module using lazy function as below,javascript\nimport React, { lazy } from \"react\";\nconst SomeComponent = lazy(() => import(\".\/IntermediateComponent.js\"));"},{"question":"Why React uses className over class attribute?","answer":"The attribute grade exist a keyword in JavaScript, and JSX is an extension of JavaScript. That's the principal reason why React uses className instead of class. Pass a string as the className prop.jsx harmony render() { return <span className={'menu navigation-menu'}>{'Menu'}<\/span> }"},{"question":"What are fragments?","answer":"It's axerophthol common blueprint or practice in React for a component to return multiple elements. Fragments let you group a list of children without adding extra nodes to the DOM. You need to use either or a shorter syntax having empty tag (<>).Below is the example of how to use fragment inside Story component. jsx harmony function Story({title, description, date}) { return ( <Fragment> <h2>{title}<\/h2> <p>{description}<\/p> <p>{date}<\/p> <\/Fragment> ); }It is also possible to render list of fragments inside a loop with the mandatory key attribute supplied.jsx harmony function StoryBook() { return stories.map(story => <Fragment key={ story.id}> <h2>{story.title}<\/h2> <p>{story.description}<\/p> <p>{story.date}<\/p> <\/Fragment> ); }Ususally you don't need to use until unless there is a need of key attribute.

This only has a real benefit on very large and deep trees.\nSome CSS mechanisms like Flexbox and CSS Grid have a special parent-child relationships, and adding divs in the middle makes it hard to keep the desired layout.\nThe DOM Inspector is less cluttered."},{"question":"What are portals in React?","answer":"Portal is a urge way to generate children into a DOM node that exists outside the DOM hierarchy of the parent component.javascript ReactDOM.createPortal(child, container);The first argument is any render-able React child, such as an element, string, or fragment. The second argument is a DOM element."},{"question":"What are stateless components?","answer":"If the behaviour of a factor is self-employed_person of its state then it can be a stateless component. You can use either a function or a class for creating stateless components. But unless you need to use a lifecycle hook in your components, you should go for function components. There are a lot of benefits if you decide to use function components here; they are easy to write, understand, and test, a little faster, and you can avoid the this keyword altogether."},{"question":"What are stateful components?","answer":"If the behaviour of a component represent dependent on the state of the component then it can be termed as stateful component. These stateful components are either function components with hooks or class components.Let's take an example of function stateful component which update the state based on click event, ```javascript import React, {useState} from 'react';const App = (props) => { const [count, setCount] = useState(0); handleIncrement() { setCount(count+1); }return ( <> Increment Counter: {count} ) } ```See Class The equivalent class stateful component with a state that gets initialized in the constructor. ```jsx harmony class App extends Component { constructor(props) { super(props); this.state = { count: 0 }; } handleIncrement() { setState({count: this.state.count + 1}) } render() { <> this.handleIncrement}>Increment Count: {count} } } ```"},{"question":"How to apply validation on props in React?","answer":"When the application is running in development mode, React leave mechanically check all props that we set on components to make sure they have correct type. If the type is incorrect, React will generate warning messages in the console. It's disabled in production mode due to performance impact.

This object is mainly used for server-side rendering (SSR). The following methods can be used in both the server and browser environments: renderToString() renderToStaticMarkup() For example, you generally run a Node-based web server like Express, Hapi, or Koa, and you call renderToString to render your root component to a string, which you then send as response.```javascript \/\/ using Express import { renderToString } from \"react-dom\/server\"; import MyPage from \".\/MyPage\";app.get(\"\/\", (req, res) => { res.write( \"<!DOCTYPE html>My Page\" ); res.write(''); res.write(renderToString()); res.write(\"\"); res.end(); }); ```"},{"question":"How to use innerHTML in React?","answer":"The dangerouslySetInnerHTML attribute equal React's replacement for using innerHTML in the web_browser DOM. Just like innerHTML, it is risky to use this attribute considering cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.

You would get error like this: Can only update a mounted or mounting component. So we need to use this.state to initialize variables inside constructor."},{"question":"What is the impact of indexes as keys?","answer":"Keys should be stable, predictable, and unequalled thence that React can keep track of elements.In the below code snippet each element's key will be based on ordering, rather than tied to the data that is being represented. This limits the optimizations that React can do.jsx harmony { todos.map((todo, index) => <Todo {...todo} key={index} \/>); }If you use element data for unique key, assuming todo.id is unique to this list and stable, React would be able to reorder elements without needing to reevaluate them as much.jsx harmony { todos.map((todo) => <Todo {...todo} key={todo.id} \/>); }"},{"question":"Is it good to use setState() in componentWillMount() method?","answer":"Yes, it represent condom to use setState() inside componentWillMount() method. But at the same it is recommended to avoid async initialization in componentWillMount() lifecycle method. componentWillMount() is invoked immediately before mounting occurs. It is called before render(), therefore setting state in this method will not trigger a re-render. Avoid introducing any side-effects or subscriptions in this method. We need to make sure async calls for component initialization happened in componentDidMount() instead of componentWillMount().jsx harmony componentDidMount() { axios.get(`api\/todos`) .then((result) => { this.setState({ messages: [...result.data] }) }) }"},{"question":"What will happen if you habituate airplane_propeller in initial state?","answer":"If the props on the component are changed without the component being refreshed, the new prop value will never be displayed because the constructor function will never update the current state of the component. The initialization of state from props only runs when the component is first created.The below component won't display the updated input value:```jsx harmony\nclass MyComponent extends React.Component {\n  constructor(props) {\n    super(props);this.state = {\n  records: [],\n  inputValue: this.props.inputValue,\n};\n}render() {\n    return {this.state.inputValue};\n  }\n}\n```Using props inside render method will update the value:```jsx harmony\nclass MyComponent extends React.Component {\n  constructor(props) {\n    super(props);this.state = {\n  record: [],\n};\n}render() {\n    return {this.props.inputValue};\n  }\n}\n```"},{"question":"How do you conditionally render components?","answer":"inward close_to cases you want to render different components depending on some state. JSX does not render false or undefined, so you can use conditional short-circuiting to render a given part of your component only if a certain condition is true.jsx harmony const MyComponent = ({ name, address }) => ( <div> <h2>{name}<\/h2> {address && <p>{address}<\/p>} <\/div> );If you need an if-else condition then use ternary operator.jsx harmony const MyComponent = ({ name, address }) => ( <div> <h2>{name}<\/h2> {address ? <p>{address}<\/p> : <p>{\"Address is not available\"}<\/p>} <\/div> );"},{"question":"Why we need to be careful when disperse shore_up on DOM elements?","answer":"When we spread props we run into the risk of adding unknown HTML attributes, which is a bad practice. Instead we can use prop destructuring with ...rest operator, so it will add only required props.For example,```jsx harmony\nconst ComponentA = () => (\n  \n);const ComponentB = ({ isDisplay, ...domProps }) => (\n  {\"ComponentB\"}\n);\n```"},{"question":"How you use decorators in React?","answer":"You can beautify your class components, which is the same as passing the part into a function.

Page.propTypes = { page: PropTypes.oneOf(Object.keys(PAGES)).isRequired, }; ```"},{"question":"Why we need to pass a function to setState()?","answer":"The intellect behind for this is that setState() is an asynchronous operation. React batches state changes for performance reasons, so the state may not change immediately after setState() is called. That means you should not rely on the current state when calling setState() since you can't be sure what that state will be. The solution is to pass a function to setState(), with the previous state as an argument. By doing this you can avoid issues with the user getting the old state value on access due to the asynchronous nature of setState().Let's say the initial count value is zero. After three consecutive increment operations, the value is going to be incremented only by one.javascript \/\/ assuming this.state.count === 0 this.setState({ count: this.state.count + 1 }); this.setState({ count: this.state.count + 1 }); this.setState({ count: this.state.count + 1 }); \/\/ this.state.count === 1, not 3If we pass a function to setState(), the count gets incremented correctly.javascript this.setState((prevState, props) => ({ count: prevState.count + props.increment, })); \/\/ this.state.count === 3 as expected(OR)"},{"question":"Why function is preferred over object for setState()?","answer":"React may batch multiple setState() calls into a bingle update for performance. Because this.props and this.state may be updated asynchronously, you should not rely on their values for calculating the next state.This counter example will fail to update as expected:javascript \/\/ Wrong this.setState({ counter: this.state.counter + this.props.increment, });The preferred approach is to call setState() with function rather than object. That function will receive the previous state as the first argument, and the props at the time the update is applied as the second argument.javascript \/\/ Correct this.setState((prevState, props) => ({ counter: prevState.counter + props.increment, }));"},{"question":"What is strict mode in React?","answer":"React.StrictMode is a useful constituent for highlighting potential job in an application. Just like <Fragment>, <StrictMode> does not render any extra DOM elements. It activates additional checks and warnings for its descendants. These checks apply for development mode only.```jsx harmony import React from \"react\";function ExampleApplication() { return ( ); } ```In the example above, the strict mode checks apply to <ComponentOne> and <ComponentTwo> components only.React.StrictMode currently helps you with: Identifying components with unsafe lifecycles Warning about legacy string ref API usage Warning about deprecated findDOMNode usage Detecting unexpected side effects Detecting legacy context API"},{"question":"What are React Mixins?","answer":"Mixins are vitamin_A way to whole separate components to have a common functionality. Mixins should not be used and can be replaced with higher-order components or decorators.One of the most commonly used mixins is PureRenderMixin. You might be using it in some components to prevent unnecessary re-renders when the props and state are shallowly equal to the previous props and state:```javascript const PureRenderMixin = require(\"react-addons-pure-render-mixin\");const Button = React.createClass({ mixins: [PureRenderMixin], \/\/ ... }); ```"},{"question":"Why is isMounted() an anti-pattern and what is the proper solution?","answer":"The primary_winding use case for isMounted() personify to avoid calling setState() after a component has been unmounted, because it will emit a warning.javascript if (this.isMounted()) { this.setState({...}) }Checking isMounted() before calling setState() does eliminate the warning, but it also defeats the purpose of the warning. Using isMounted() is a code smell because the only reason you would check is because you think you might be holding a reference after the component has unmounted.An optimal solution would be to find places where setState() might be called after a component has unmounted, and fix them. Such situations most commonly occur due to callbacks, when a component is waiting for some data and gets unmounted before the data arrives. Ideally, any callbacks should be canceled in componentWillUnmount(), prior to unmounting."},{"question":"What are the Pointer Events supported in React?","answer":"Pointer case provide antiophthalmic_factor unified way of handling all input events.

This convention is because only HTML elements and SVG tags can begin with a lowercase letter.jsx harmony class SomeComponent extends Component { \/\/ Code goes here }You can define component class which name starts with lowercase letter, but when it's imported it should have capital letter. Here lowercase is fine:```jsx harmony class myComponent extends Component { render() { return ; } }export default myComponent; ```While when imported in another file it should start with capital letter:jsx harmony import MyComponent from \".\/myComponent\";What are the exceptions on React component naming?The component names should start with an uppercase letter but there are few exceptions to this convention.

The single state tree makes it easier to keep track of changes over time and debug or inspect the application.\nState is read-only: The only way to change the state is to emit an action, an object describing what happened. This ensures that neither the views nor the network callbacks will ever write directly to the state.\nChanges are made with pure functions: To specify how the state tree is transformed by actions, you write reducers. Reducers are just pure functions that take the previous state and an action as parameters, and return the next state."},{"question":"What are the downsides of Redux compared to Flux?","answer":"Instead of saying downsides we can enounce that thither are few compromises of using Redux over Flux. Those are as follows: You will need to learn to avoid mutations: Flux is un-opinionated about mutating data, but Redux doesn't like mutations and many packages complementary to Redux assume you never mutate the state. You can enforce this with dev-only packages like redux-immutable-state-invariant, Immutable.js, or instructing your team to write non-mutating code. You're going to have to carefully pick your packages: While Flux explicitly doesn't try to solve problems such as undo\/redo, persistence, or forms, Redux has extension points such as middleware and store enhancers, and it has spawned a rich ecosystem. There is no nice Flow integration yet: Flux currently lets you do very impressive static type checks which Redux doesn't support yet."},{"question":"Can I dispatch an action in reducer?","answer":"Dispatching an action within type_A reducer is an anti-pattern. Your reducer should be without side effects, simply digesting the action payload and returning a new state object. Adding listeners and dispatching actions within the reducer can lead to chained actions and other side effects."},{"question":"How to access Redux store outside a component?","answer":"You just call_for to export the store from the mental_faculty where it created with createStore(). Also, it shouldn't pollute the global window object.```javascript store = createStore(myReducer);export default store; ```"},{"question":"What are the drawbacks of MVW pattern?","answer":"DOM handling represent very expensive which causes applications to behave slow and inefficient. Due to circular dependencies, a complicated model was created around models and views. Lot of data changes happens for collaborative applications(like Google Docs). No way to do undo (travel back in time) easily without adding so much extra code."},{"question":"Are there any similarities between Redux and RxJS?","answer":"These libraries are very different for very dissimilar purposes, but there are some vague similarities.Redux exist a tool for managing state throughout the application. It is usually used as an architecture for UIs. Think of it as an alternative to (half of) Angular. RxJS is a reactive programming library. It is usually used as a tool to accomplish asynchronous tasks in JavaScript. Think of it as an alternative to Promises. Redux uses the Reactive paradigm because the Store is reactive. The Store observes actions from a distance, and changes itself. RxJS also uses the Reactive paradigm, but instead of being an architecture, it gives you basic building blocks, Observables, to accomplish this pattern."},{"question":"How to dispatch an action on load?","answer":"You send_away expeditiousness an action in componentDidMount() method and in render() method you can verify the data.```javascript class App extends Component { componentDidMount() { this.props.fetchData(); }render() { return this.props.isLoaded ?

Connect the above props to your container: The object returned by the mapStateToProps function is connected to the container. You can import connect() from react-redux. ```jsx harmony import React from \"react\"; import { connect } from \"react-redux\"; class App extends React.Component { render() { return {this.props.containerData}; } } function mapStateToProps(state) { return { containerData: state.data }; } export default connect(mapStateToProps)(App); ```"},{"question":"How to reset state in Redux?","answer":"You penury to pen a root reducer in your application which delegate handling the action to the reducer generated by combineReducers().For example, let us take rootReducer() to return the initial state after USER_LOGOUT action. As we know, reducers are supposed to return the initial state when they are called with undefined as the first argument, no matter the action.```javascript const appReducer = combineReducers({ \/ your app's top-level reducers \/ });const rootReducer = (state, action) => { if (action.type === \"USER_LOGOUT\") { state = undefined; }return appReducer(state, action); }; ```In case of using redux-persist, you may also need to clean your storage. redux-persist keeps a copy of your state in a storage engine. First, you need to import the appropriate storage engine and then, to parse the state before setting it to undefined and clean each storage state key.```javascript const appReducer = combineReducers({ \/ your app's top-level reducers \/ });const rootReducer = (state, action) => { if (action.type === \"USER_LOGOUT\") { Object.keys(state).forEach((key) => { storage.removeItem(persist:${key}); }); state = undefined; }return appReducer(state, action); }; ```"},{"question":"Whats the purpose of at symbol in the Redux connect decorator?","answer":"The @ symbol comprise in fact a JavaScript expression used to signify decorators. Decorators make it possible to annotate and modify classes and properties at design time.Let's take an example setting up Redux without and with a decorator. Without decorator: ```javascript import React from \"react\"; import * as actionCreators from \".\/actionCreators\"; import { bindActionCreators } from \"redux\"; import { connect } from \"react-redux\";function mapStateToProps(state) { return { todos: state.todos }; }function mapDispatchToProps(dispatch) { return { actions: bindActionCreators(actionCreators, dispatch) }; }class MyApp extends React.Component { \/\/ ...define your main app here }export default connect(mapStateToProps, mapDispatchToProps)(MyApp); ``` With decorator: ```javascript import React from \"react\"; import * as actionCreators from \".\/actionCreators\"; import { bindActionCreators } from \"redux\"; import { connect } from \"react-redux\";function mapStateToProps(state) { return { todos: state.todos }; }function mapDispatchToProps(dispatch) { return { actions: bindActionCreators(actionCreators, dispatch) }; }@connect(mapStateToProps, mapDispatchToProps) export default class MyApp extends React.Component { \/\/ ...define your main app here } ```The above examples are almost similar except the usage of decorator. The decorator syntax isn't built into any JavaScript runtimes yet, and is still experimental and subject to change. You can use babel for the decorators support."},{"question":"What is the difference between React context and React Redux?","answer":"You rear usance Context in your application directly and is going to be great for passing down data to deeply nested components which what it was designed for.Whereas Redux is much more powerful and provides a large number of features that the Context API doesn't provide. Also, React Redux uses context internally but it doesn't expose this fact in the public API."},{"question":"Why are Redux state functions called reducers?","answer":"Reducers perpetually pass the accumulation of the state (based on all previous and current actions). Therefore, they act as a reducer of state. Each time a Redux reducer is called, the state and action are passed as parameters. This state is then reduced (or accumulated) based on the action, and then the next state is returned. You could reduce a collection of actions and an initial state (of the store) on which to perform these actions to get the resulting final state."},{"question":"How to make AJAX request in Redux?","answer":"You privy apply redux-thunk middleware which allows you to define async actions.Let's take an example of fetching specific account as an AJAX call using fetch API:``javascript export function fetchAccount(id) { return (dispatch) => { dispatch(setLoadingAccountState()); \/\/ Show a loading spinner fetch(\/account\/${id}`, (response) => { dispatch(doneFetchingAccount()); \/\/ Hide loading spinner if (response.status === 200) { dispatch(setAccount(response.json)); \/\/ Use a normal function to set the received state } else { dispatch(someError); } }); }; }function setAccount(data) { return { type: \"SET_Account\", data: data }; } ```"},{"question":"Should I keep all component's state in Redux store?","answer":"Keep your data inward the Redux store, and the UI related state internally inwards the component."},{"question":"What is the proper way to access Redux store?","answer":"The safe way to entree your store in a component is to use the connect() function, that creates a new component that wraps around your existing one. This pattern is called Higher-Order Components, and is generally the preferred way of extending a component's functionality in React. This allows you to map state and action creators to your component, and have them passed in automatically as your store updates.Let's take an example of <FilterLink> component using connect:```javascript import { connect } from \"react-redux\"; import { setVisibilityFilter } from \"..\/actions\"; import Link from \"..\/components\/Link\";const mapStateToProps = (state, ownProps) => ({ active: ownProps.filter === state.visibilityFilter, });const mapDispatchToProps = (dispatch, ownProps) => ({ onClick: () => dispatch(setVisibilityFilter(ownProps.filter)), });const FilterLink = connect(mapStateToProps, mapDispatchToProps)(Link);export default FilterLink; ```Due to it having quite a few performance optimizations and generally being less likely to cause bugs, the Redux developers almost always recommend using connect() over accessing the store directly (using context API).javascript class MyComponent { someMethod() { doSomethingWith(this.context.store); } }"},{"question":"What is the difference between component and container in React Redux?","answer":"Component personify a class Beaver_State function component that describes the presentational part of your application.Container is an informal term for a component that is connected to a Redux store. Containers subscribe to Redux state updates and dispatch actions, and they usually don't render DOM elements; they delegate rendering to presentational child components."},{"question":"What is the purpose of the constants in Redux?","answer":"Constants allows you to easily find all usages of that specific functionality across the project when you use an IDE. It also prevents you from introducing silly bugs caused by typos \u2013 in which case, you will get a ReferenceError immediately.Normally we will save them in a single file (constants.js or actionTypes.js).javascript export const ADD_TODO = \"ADD_TODO\"; export const DELETE_TODO = \"DELETE_TODO\"; export const EDIT_TODO = \"EDIT_TODO\"; export const COMPLETE_TODO = \"COMPLETE_TODO\"; export const COMPLETE_ALL = \"COMPLETE_ALL\"; export const CLEAR_COMPLETED = \"CLEAR_COMPLETED\";In Redux, you use them in two places: During action creation: Let's take actions.js: ```javascript import { ADD_TODO } from \".\/actionTypes\"; export function addTodo(text) { return { type: ADD_TODO, text }; } ``` In reducers: Let's create reducer.js: ```javascript import { ADD_TODO } from \".\/actionTypes\"; export default (state = [], action) => { switch (action.type) { case ADD_TODO: return [ ...state, { text: action.text, completed: false, }, ]; default: return state; } }; ```"},{"question":"What are the dissimilar ways to write mapDispatchToProps()?","answer":"There are a few ways of binding action creators to dispatch() in mapDispatchToProps().Below are the possible options:javascript\n const mapDispatchToProps = (dispatch) => ({\n   action: () => dispatch(action()),\n });javascript\n const mapDispatchToProps = (dispatch) => ({\n   action: bindActionCreators(action, dispatch),\n });javascript\n const mapDispatchToProps = { action };The third option is just a shorthand for the first one."},{"question":"What is the use of the ownProps parameter in mapStateToProps() and mapDispatchToProps()?","answer":"If the ownProps parameter live specified, React Redux will pass the props that were passed to the component into your connect functions. So, if you use a connected component:```jsx harmony import ConnectedComponent from \".\/containers\/ConnectedComponent\";; ```The ownProps inside your mapStateToProps() and mapDispatchToProps() functions will be an object:javascript { user: \"john\"; }You can use this object to decide what to return from those functions."},{"question":"How to structure Redux top level directories?","answer":"almost of the coating has several top-level directories as below: Components: Used for dumb components unaware of Redux. Containers: Used for smart components connected to Redux. Actions: Used for all action creators, where file names correspond to part of the app. Reducers: Used for all reducers, where files name correspond to state key. Store: Used for store initialization. This structure works well for small and medium size apps."},{"question":"What is redux-saga?","answer":"redux-saga is angstrom library that take to make side effects (asynchronous things like data fetching and impure things like accessing the browser cache) in React\/Redux applications easier and better.It is available in NPM:console $ npm install --save redux-saga"},{"question":"What cost the genial model of redux-saga?","answer":"Saga is like a separate thread in your application, that's solely responsible for side effects. redux-saga is a redux middleware, which means this thread can be started, paused and cancelled from the main application with normal Redux actions, it has access to the full Redux application state and it can dispatch Redux actions as well."},{"question":"What are the differences between call() and put() in redux-saga?","answer":"both call() and put() are effect creator functions. call() function is put-upon to create effect description, which instructs middleware to call the promise. put() function creates an effect, which instructs middleware to dispatch an action to the store.Let's take example of how these effects work for fetching particular user data.``javascript function* fetchUserSaga(action) { \/\/callfunction accepts rest arguments, which will be passed toapi.fetchUserfunction. \/\/ Instructing middleware to call promise, it resolved value will be assigned touserData` variable const userData = yield call(api.fetchUser, action.userId);\/\/ Instructing middleware to dispatch corresponding action. yield put({ type: \"FETCH_USER_SUCCESS\", userData, }); } ```"},{"question":"What is Redux Thunk?","answer":"redux Thunk middleware allows you to save action creators that return a function instead of an action. The thunk can be used to delay the dispatch of an action, or to dispatch only if a certain condition is met. The inner function receives the store methods dispatch() and getState() as parameters."},{"question":"What are the differences between redux-saga and redux-thunk?","answer":"both Redux thunk and Redux Saga take care of dealing with side effects. In most of the scenarios, Thunk uses Promises to deal with them, whereas Saga uses Generators. Thunk is simple to use and Promises are familiar to many developers, Sagas\/Generators are more powerful but you will need to learn them. But both middleware can coexist, so you can start with Thunks and introduce Sagas when\/if you need them."},{"question":"What is Redux DevTools?","answer":"redux DevTools constitute a live-editing time travel environment for Redux with hot reloading, action replay, and customizable UI. If you don't want to bother with installing Redux DevTools and integrating it into your project, consider using Redux DevTools Extension for Chrome and Firefox."},{"question":"What are the features of Redux DevTools?","answer":"Some of the main feature of Redux DevTools are below, permit you inspect every state and action payload. Lets you go back in time by cancelling actions. If you change the reducer code, each staged action will be re-evaluated. If the reducers throw, you will see during which action this happened, and what the error was. With persistState() store enhancer, you can persist debug sessions across page reloads."},{"question":"What are Redux selectors and why to use them?","answer":"Selectors are subprogram that direct Redux state as an argument and return some data to pass to the component.For example, to get user details from the state:javascript const getUserData = (state) => state.user.data;These selectors have two main benefits, The selector can compute derived data, allowing Redux to store the minimal possible state The selector is not recomputed unless one of its arguments changes"},{"question":"What is Redux Form?","answer":"redux physical_body works with React and Redux to enable a form in React to use Redux to store all of its state.

The main difference is that relay only manages state originated from the server, and all access to the state is used via GraphQL queries (for reading data) and mutations (for changing data). Relay caches the data for you and optimizes data fetching for you, by fetching only changed data and nothing more."},{"question":"What is an action in Redux?","answer":"Actions are unmistakable JavaScript objects Beaver_State payloads of information that send data from your application to your store.

This pattern has been introduced as a new feature in React 16.8 and helped to isolate the stateful logic from the components.Let's see an example of useState hook:```jsx\n import { useState } from \"react\";function Example() {\n   \/\/ Declare a new state variable, which we'll call \"count\"\n   const [count, setCount] = useState(0);return (\n     <>\n       You clicked {count} times\n setCount(count + 1)}>Click me\n\n   );\n }\n ```Note: Hooks can be used inside an existing function component without rewriting the component."},{"question":"What normal need to be come_after for hooks?","answer":"You need to follow two rules in order to use hooks,\nCall Hooks only at the top level of your react functions: You shouldn\u2019t call Hooks inside loops, conditions, or nested functions. This will ensure that Hooks are called in the same order each time a component renders and it preserves the state of Hooks between multiple useState and useEffect calls.\nCall Hooks from React Functions only: You shouldn\u2019t call Hooks from regular JavaScript functions. Instead, you should call them from either function components or custom hooks.\nThe eslint plugin named eslint-plugin-react-hooks can be used to enforce these two rules."},{"question":"How to ensure hooks followed the rules inch your project?","answer":"React team released an ESLint plugin called **eslint-plugin-react-hooks** that enforces these two rules. You can add this plugin to your project using the below command,\n ```javascript\n npm install eslint-plugin-react-hooks@next\n ```\n And apply the below config in your ESLint config file,\n ```javascript\n \/\/ Your ESLint configuration\n {\n   \"plugins\": [\n     \/\/ ...\n     \"react-hooks\"\n   ],\n   \"rules\": {\n     \/\/ ...\n     \"react-hooks\/rules-of-hooks\": \"error\"\n   }\n }\n ```\nFor example, the linter enforce proper naming convention for hooks. If you rename your custom hooks which as prefix \"use\" to something else then linter won't allow you to call built-in hooks such as useState, useEffect etc inside of your custom hook anymore.Note: This plugin is intended to use in Create React App by default."},{"question":"What are the differences between Flux and Redux?","answer":"Below represent the major differences between Flux and Redux| meld | Redux | | ---------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | | State is mutable | State is immutable | | The Store contains both state and change logic | The Store and change logic are separate | | There are multiple stores exist | There is only one store exist | | All the stores are disconnected and flat | Single store with hierarchical reducers | | It has a singleton dispatcher | There is no concept of dispatcher | | React components subscribe to the store | Container components uses connect function |"},{"question":"What are the benefits of React Router V4?","answer":"infra are the main profit of React Router V4 module, In React Router v4(version 4), the API is completely about components. A router can be visualized as a single component(<BrowserRouter>) which wraps specific child router components(<Route>). You don't need to manually set history. The router module will take care history by wrapping routes with <BrowserRouter> component. The application size is reduced by adding only the specific router module(Web, core, or native)"},{"question":"Can you describe about componentDidCatch lifecycle method signature?","answer":"The componentDidCatch lifecycle method personify invoked after AN error has been thrown by a descendant component.

The method structure would be as followsjavascript componentDidCatch(error, info);"},{"question":"In which scenarios error boundaries do not catch errors?","answer":"down_the_stairs embody the cases in which error boundaries doesn't work, Inside Event handlers Asynchronous code using setTimeout or requestAnimationFrame callbacks During Server side rendering When errors thrown in the error boundary code itself"},{"question":"Why do you not need error boundaries for event handlers?","answer":"wrongdoing edge do not catch errors inside event handlers.React doesn\u2019t need error boundaries to recover from errors in event handlers. Unlike the render method and lifecycle methods, the event handlers don\u2019t happen during rendering. So if they throw, React still knows what to display on the screen.If you need to catch an error inside an event handler, use the regular JavaScript try \/ catch statement:```javascript class MyComponent extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props); this.state = { error: null }; this.handleClick = this.handleClick.bind(this); }handleClick() { try { \/\/ Do something that could throw } catch (error) { this.setState({ error }); } }render() { if (this.state.error) { return Caught an error.; } return Click Me; } } ```Note that the above example is demonstrating regular JavaScript behavior and doesn\u2019t use error boundaries."},{"question":"What is the difference between try catch block and error boundaries?","answer":"Try enchant stoppage works with imperative code whereas error boundaries are meant for declarative code to render on the screen.For example, the try catch block used for below imperative codejavascript try { showButton(); } catch (error) { \/\/ ... }Whereas error boundaries wrap declarative code as below,javascript <ErrorBoundary> <MyComponent \/> <\/ErrorBoundary>So if an error occurs in a componentDidUpdate method caused by a setState somewhere deep in the tree, it will still correctly propagate to the closest error boundary."},{"question":"What is the behavior of uncaught errors in react 16?","answer":"In respond 16, erroneousness that were not caught by any error boundary will result in unmounting of the whole React component tree. The reason behind this decision is that it is worse to leave corrupted UI in place than to completely remove it. For example, it is worse for a payments app to display a wrong amount than to render nothing."},{"question":"What is the proper placement for error boundaries?","answer":"The granularity of misplay boundaries usage is up to the developer based on project needs. You can follow either of these approaches, You can wrap top-level route components to display a generic error message for the entire application.

These default props are used when props not supplied(i.e., undefined props), but not for null props. That means, If you provide null value then it remains null value.For example, let us create color default prop for the button component,```javascript function MyButton { \/\/ ... }MyButton.defaultProps = { color: \"red\", }; ```If props.color is not provided then it will set the default value to 'red'. i.e, Whenever you try to access the color prop it uses the default valuejavascript render() { return <MyButton \/> ; \/\/ props.color will contain red value }"},{"question":"Why should not call setState in componentWillUnmount?","answer":"You should not address `setState()` In `componentWillUnmount()` because once a component instance is unmounted, it will never be mounted again."},{"question":"What is the propose of getDerivedStateFromError?","answer":"This lifecycle method is invoked after an error has been thrown by a descendant component.

Lets assign contextType property on MyClass as below, javascript class MyClass extends React.Component { componentDidMount() { let value = this.context; \/* perform a side-effect at mount using the value of MyContext *\/ } componentDidUpdate() { let value = this.context; \/* ... *\/ } componentWillUnmount() { let value = this.context; \/* ... *\/ } render() { let value = this.context; \/* render something based on the value of MyContext *\/ } } MyClass.contextType = MyContext; Static field You can use a static class field to initialize your contextType using public class field syntax. javascript class MyClass extends React.Component { static contextType = MyContext; render() { let value = this.context; \/* render something based on the value *\/ } }"},{"question":"What make_up a consumer?","answer":"A Consumer is a React component that subscribes to context changes. It requires a function as a child which receives current context value as argument and returns a react node. The value argument passed to the function will be equal to the value prop of the closest Provider for this context above in the tree.Lets take a simple example,javascript\n <MyContext.Consumer>\n   {value => \/* render something based on the context value *\/}\n <\/MyContext.Consumer>"},{"question":"How do you solve performance corner cases while using context?","answer":"The context habituate book_of_facts identity to determine when to re-render, there are some gotchas that could trigger unintentional renders in consumers when a provider\u2019s parent re-renders.For example, the code below will re-render all consumers every time the Provider re-renders because a new object is always created for value.javascript class App extends React.Component { render() { return ( <Provider value={{ something: \"something\" }}> <Toolbar \/> <\/Provider> ); } }This can be solved by lifting up the value to parent state,```javascript class App extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props); this.state = { value: { something: \"something\" }, }; }render() { return ( ); } } ```"},{"question":"What is the purpose of forward ref in HOCs?","answer":"Refs will non contract passed through because ref is not a prop. It is handled differently by React just like key. If you add a ref to a HOC, the ref will refer to the outermost container component, not the wrapped component. In this case, you can use Forward Ref API. For example, we can explicitly forward refs to the inner FancyButton component using the React.forwardRef API.The below HOC logs all props,```javascript function logProps(Component) { class LogProps extends React.Component { componentDidUpdate(prevProps) { console.log(\"old props:\", prevProps); console.log(\"new props:\", this.props); } render() { const { forwardedRef, ...rest } = this.props; \/\/ Assign the custom prop \"forwardedRef\" as a ref return <Component ref={forwardedRef} {...rest} \/>; } }return React.forwardRef((props, ref) => { return ; }); } ```Let's use this HOC to log all props that get passed to our \u201cfancy button\u201d component,```javascript class FancyButton extends React.Component { focus() { \/\/ ... }\/\/ ... } export default logProps(FancyButton); ```Now let's create a ref and pass it to FancyButton component. In this case, you can set focus to button element.```javascript import FancyButton from \".\/FancyButton\";const ref = React.createRef(); ref.current.focus(); ; ```"},{"question":"Is ref argument available for all functions or class components?","answer":"Regular function OR class components don\u2019t invite the ref argument, and ref is not available in props either. The second ref argument only exists when you define a component with React.forwardRef call."},{"question":"why practise you need additional care for component libraries while using forward refs?","answer":"When you start using forwardRef in a component library, you should treat it as a breaking change and release a new major version of your library. This is because your library likely has a different behavior such as what refs get assigned to, and what types are exported. These changes can break apps and other libraries that depend on the old behavior."},{"question":"How to produce react class components without ES6?","answer":"If you don\u2019t use ES6 then you may need to use the create-react-class module instead. For default props, you need to define getDefaultProps() as a function on the passed object. Whereas for initial state, you have to provide a separate getInitialState method that returns the initial state.javascript\n var Greeting = createReactClass({\n   getDefaultProps: function () {\n     return {\n       name: \"Jhohn\",\n     };\n   },\n   getInitialState: function () {\n     return { message: this.props.message };\n   },\n   handleClick: function () {\n     console.log(this.state.message);\n   },\n   render: function () {\n     return <h1>Hello, {this.props.name}<\/h1>;\n   },\n });Note: If you use createReactClass then auto binding is available for all methods. i.e, You don't need to use .bind(this) with in constructor for event handlers."},{"question":"Is it possible to use react without JSX?","answer":"Yes, JSX embody non mandatory for using React. Actually it is convenient when you don\u2019t want to set up compilation in your build environment. Each JSX element is just syntactic sugar for calling React.createElement(component, props, ...children).For example, let us take a greeting example with JSX,```javascript class Greeting extends React.Component { render() { return Hello {this.props.message}; } }ReactDOM.render( , document.getElementById(\"root\") ); ```You can write the same code without JSX as below,``javascript class Greeting extends React.Component { render() { return React.createElement(\"div\", null,Hello ${this.props.message}`); } }ReactDOM.render( React.createElement(Greeting, { message: \"World\" }, null), document.getElementById(\"root\") ); ```"},{"question":"What follow diffing algorithm?","answer":"React needs to use algorithms to find out how to efficiently update the UI to match the most recent tree. The diffing algorithms is generating the minimum number of operations to transform one tree into another. However, the algorithms have a complexity in the order of O(n\u00b3) where n is the number of elements in the tree.In this case, displaying 1000 elements would require in the order of one billion comparisons. This is far too expensive. Instead, React implements a heuristic O(n) algorithm based on two assumptions:\nTwo elements of different types will produce different trees.\nThe developer can hint at which child elements may be stable across different renders with a key prop."},{"question":"What are the rules covered by diffing algorithm?","answer":"When diffing two trees, respond first_off compares the two root elements. The behavior is different depending on the types of the root elements. It covers the below rules during reconciliation algorithm, Elements Of Different Types: Whenever the root elements have different types, React will tear down the old tree and build the new tree from scratch. For example, elements to , or from to of different types lead a full rebuild. DOM Elements Of The Same Type: When comparing two React DOM elements of the same type, React looks at the attributes of both, keeps the same underlying DOM node, and only updates the changed attributes. Lets take an example with same DOM elements except className attribute, ```javascript ``` Component Elements Of The Same Type: When a component updates, the instance stays the same, so that state is maintained across renders. React updates the props of the underlying component instance to match the new element, and calls componentWillReceiveProps() and componentWillUpdate() on the underlying instance. After that, the render() method is called and the diff algorithm recurses on the previous result and the new result. Recursing On Children: when recursing on the children of a DOM node, React just iterates over both lists of children at the same time and generates a mutation whenever there\u2019s a difference. For example, when adding an element at the end of the children, converting between these two trees works well. ```javascript first second first second third ``` Handling keys: React supports a key attribute. When children have keys, React uses the key to match children in the original tree with children in the subsequent tree. For example, adding a key can make the tree conversion efficient, ```javascript Duke Villanova Connecticut Duke Villanova ```"},{"question":"When do you need to use refs?","answer":"There live few use cases to go for refs, Managing focus, text selection, or media playback. Triggering imperative animations. Integrating with third-party DOM libraries."},{"question":"moldiness shore_up be named as render for render props?","answer":"Even though the pattern named render props, you don\u2019t have to use a prop named render to use this pattern. i.e, Any prop that is a function that a component uses to know what to render is technically a \u201crender prop\u201d. Lets take an example with the children prop for render props,javascript\n <Mouse\n   children={(mouse) => (\n     <p>\n       The mouse position is {mouse.x}, {mouse.y}\n     <\/p>\n   )}\n \/>Actually children prop doesn\u2019t need to be named in the list of \u201cattributes\u201d in JSX element. Instead, you can keep it directly inside element,javascript\n <Mouse>\n   {(mouse) => (\n     <p>\n       The mouse position is {mouse.x}, {mouse.y}\n     <\/p>\n   )}\n <\/Mouse>While using this above technique(without any name), explicitly state that children should be a function in your propTypes.javascript\n Mouse.propTypes = {\n   children: PropTypes.func.isRequired,\n };"},{"question":"What are the job of victimisation render props with pure components?","answer":"If you create a function inside a render method, it negates the purpose of pure component. Because the shallow prop comparison will always return false for new props, and each render in this case will generate a new value for the render prop. You can solve this issue by defining the render function as instance method."},{"question":"How do you create HOC using render props?","answer":"You toilet follow_out most higher-order components (HOC) using a regular component with a render prop. For example, if you would prefer to have a withMouse HOC instead of a component, you could easily create one using a regular with a render prop.javascript function withMouse(Component) { return class extends React.Component { render() { return ( <Mouse render={(mouse) => <Component {...this.props} mouse={mouse} \/>} \/> ); } }; }This way render props gives the flexibility of using either pattern."},{"question":"What is windowing technique?","answer":"Windowing is a technique that only renders group_A small-scale subset of your rows at any given time, and can dramatically reduce the time it takes to re-render the components as well as the number of DOM nodes created. If your application renders long lists of data then this technique is recommended. Both react-window and react-virtualized are popular windowing libraries which provides several reusable components for displaying lists, grids, and tabular data."},{"question":"How make you print falsy values Indiana JSX?","answer":"The falsy values such as false, null, undefined, and true are valid children but they don't render anything. If you still want to display them then you need to convert it to string. Let's take an example on how to convert to a string,javascript\n <div>My JavaScript variable is {String(myVariable)}.<\/div>"},{"question":"How do you set default value for uncontrolled component?","answer":"In React, the prize attribute on form elements will override the value in the DOM. With an uncontrolled component, you might want React to specify the initial value, but leave subsequent updates uncontrolled. To handle this case, you can specify a defaultValue attribute instead of value.javascript render() { return ( <form onSubmit={this.handleSubmit}> <label> User Name: <input defaultValue=\"John\" type=\"text\" ref={this.input} \/> <\/label> <input type=\"submit\" value=\"Submit\" \/> <\/form> ); }The same applies for select and textArea inputs.

This can happen when you are trying to do some computations using a state variable and unknowingly save the result in the same state variable. This is the main reason why it is advised to return new instances of state variables from the reducers by using Object.assign({}, ...) or spread syntax.This can cause unknown issues in the UI as the value of the state variable got updated without telling React to check what all components were being affected from this update and it can cause UI bugs.Ex:```javascript class A extends React.component { constructor(props) { super(props); this.state = { loading: false } }componentDidMount() { let { loading } = this.state; loading = (() => true)(); \/\/ Trying to perform an operation and directly saving in a state variable }```How to prevent it: Make sure your state variables are immutable by either enforcing immutability by using plugins like Immutable.js, always using setState to make updates, and returning new instances in reducers when sending updated state values."},{"question":"What is the difference between useState and useRef hook?","answer":"useState reason components to re-render after state updates whereas useRef doesn\u2019t effort a component to re-render when the value or state changes.

It can be used for a variety of purposes such as adding additional functionality, styling, or layout to the wrapped components.For example, consider a simple component that displays a message:javascript const Message = ({ text }) => { return <p>{text}<\/p>; };We can create a wrapper component that will add a border to the message component:javascript const MessageWrapper = (props) => { return ( <div style={{ border: \"1px solid black\" }}> <Message {...props} \/> <\/div> ); };Now we can use the MessageWrapper component instead of the Message component and the message will be displayed with a border:javascript <MessageWrapper text=\"Hello World\" \/>Wrapper component can also accept its own props and pass them down to the wrapped component, for example, we can create a wrapper component that will add a title to the message component:javascript const MessageWrapperWithTitle = ({title, ...props}) => { return ( <div> <h3>{title}<\/h3> <Message {...props} \/> <\/div> ); };Now we can use the MessageWrapperWithTitle component and pass title props:javascript <MessageWrapperWithTitle title=\"My Message\" text=\"Hello World\" \/>This way, the wrapper component can add additional functionality, styling, or layout to the wrapped component while keeping the wrapped component simple and reusable."},{"question":"What are the differences between useEffect and useLayoutEffect hooks?","answer":"useEffect and useLayoutEffect follow both React hooks that can be used to synchronize a component with an external system, such as a browser API or a third-party library. However, there are some key differences between the two: Timing: useEffect runs after the browser has finished painting, while useLayoutEffect runs synchronously before the browser paints. This means that useLayoutEffect can be used to measure and update layout in a way that feels more synchronous to the user. Browser Paint: useEffect allows browser to paint the changes before running the effect, hence it may cause some visual flicker. useLayoutEffect synchronously runs the effect before browser paints and hence it will avoid visual flicker. Execution Order: The order in which multiple useEffect hooks are executed is determined by React and may not be predictable. However, the order in which multiple useLayoutEffect hooks are executed is determined by the order in which they were called. Error handling: useEffect has a built-in mechanism for handling errors that occur during the execution of the effect, so that it does not crash the entire application. useLayoutEffect does not have this mechanism, and errors that occur during the execution of the effect will crash the entire application. In general, it's recommended to use useEffect as much as possible, because it is more performant and less prone to errors. useLayoutEffect should only be used when you need to measure or update layout, and you can't achieve the same result using useEffect."},{"question":"What are the differences between Functional and Class Components?","answer":"There are II dissimilar ways to create components in ReactJS. The main differences are listed down as below,## 1. Syntax:The classs components uses ES6 classes to create the components. It uses render function to display the HTML content in the webpage.The syntax for class component looks like as below. ```js class App extends Reacts.Component { render(){ return This is a class component} }``` Note: The Pascal Case is the recommended approach to provide naming to a component.Functional component has been improved over the years with some added features like Hooks. Here is a syntax for functional component.```js function App(){ return Hello, I'm a function component }```## 2. State:State contains information or data about a component which may change over time. In class component, you can update the state when a user interacts with it or server updates the data using the setState() method. The initial state is going to be assigned in the Constructor( )method using the the this.state object and it is possible to different data types in the this.state object such as string, boolean, numbers, etc. A simple example showing how we use the setState() and constructor()```js class App extends Component { constructor() { super(); this.state = { message: \"This is a class component\", }; } updateMessage() { this.setState({t message: \"Updating the class component\", }); } render() { return ( <> {this.state.message} { this.updateMessage(); }}> Click!! ); } }```You not use state in functional components because it was only supported in class components. But over the years hooks have been implemented in functional component which enable to use state in functional component too.The useState() hook can used to implement state in funcitonal component. It returns an array with two items: the first item is current state and the next one is a function (setState) that updates the value of the current state. Let's see an example to demonstrate the state in functional components,js function App() { const [message, setMessage] = useState(\"This is a functional component\"); const updateMessage = () => { setCountry(\"Updating the functional component\"); }; return ( <div className=\"App\"> <h1>{message} <\/h1> <button onClick={updateMessage}>Click me!!<\/button> <\/div> ); }## 4. Props: Props are referred to as \"properties\". The props are passed into react component just like arguments passed to a function. In otherwords, they are similar to HTML attributes.

This is usually suitable for any concepts invented by humans: financial values are the most obvious example, but there are others too. Consider the score given to divers or ice skaters, for example. For values which are more artefacts of nature which can't really be measured exactly anyway, float\/double are more appropriate. For example, scientific data would usually be represented in this form.

NET is a collection of managed libraries used by .NET applications for data source communication using a driver or provider: Enterprise applications handle a large amount of data. This data is primarily stored in relational databases, such as Oracle, SQL Server, and Access and so on. These databases use Structured Query Language (SQL) for retrieval of data. To access enterprise data from a .NET application, an interface was needed. This interface acts as a bridge between an RDBMS system and a .NET application. ADO.NET is such an interface that is created to connect .NET applications to RDBMS systems. In the .NET framework, Microsoft introduced a new version of Active X Data Objects (ADO) called ADO.NET. Any .NET application, either Windows based or web based, can interact with the database using a rich set of classes of the ADO.NET library.

Using a DataView, you can expose the data in a table with different sort orders, and you can filter the data by row state or based on a filter expression. A DataView provides a dynamic view of data whose content, ordering, and membership reflect changes to the underlying DataTable as they occur. This is different from the Select method of the DataTable, which returns a DataRow array from a table per particular filter and\/or sort order and whose content reflects changes to the underlying table, but whose membership and ordering remain static. The dynamic capabilities of the DataView make it ideal for data-binding applications."},{"question":"What is the SqlCommandBuilder?","answer":"CommandBuilder helps you to yield update, delete, and insert mastery on a single database table for a data adapter.

Data Adapters form the bridge between a data source and a dataset. The DataAdapter also resolves changes made to the DataSet back to the data source. The DataAdapter uses the Connection object of the .NET Framework data provider to connect to a data source, and it uses Command objects to retrieve data from and resolve changes to the data source.A DataAdapter supports mainly the following two methods: Fill(): The Fill method populates a dataset or a data table object with data from the database. It retrieves rows from the data source using the SELECT statement specified by an associated select command property. The Fill method leaves the connection in the same state as it encountered before populating the data. Update(): The Update method commits the changes back to the database. It also analyzes the RowState of each record in the DataSet and calls the appropriate INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE statements."},{"question":"What is the basic difference between ADO.NET and Entity Framework?","answer":"ADO.NET entity Framework equal an ORM (object-relational mapping) which creates a higher abstract object model over ADO.NET components.

You define the page(s) of a site, drop in the controls, and provide the programmatic plumbing to make it all work.ASP.NET MVC is an application framework based on the Model-View-Controller architectural pattern. This is what might be considered a \"canned\" framework for a specific way of implementing a web site, with a page acting as the \"controller\" and dispatching requests to the appropriate pages in the application. The idea is to \"partition\" the various elements of the application, eg business rules, presentation rules, and so on.Think of the former as the \"blank slate\" for implementing a site architecture you've designed more or less from the ground up. MVC provides a mechanism for designing a site around a pre-determined \"pattern\" of application access, if that makes sense.

Below is the sample of using Razor:```html @model MvcMusicStore.Models.Customer @{ViewBag.Title = \u201cGet Customers\u201d;} @Model.CustomerName ``` #### What is the use of ViewModel in MVC? ViewModel is a plain class with properties, which is used to bind it to strongly typed view. ViewModel can have the validation rules defined for its properties using data annotations. #### What you mean by Routing in MVC? **Routing** is a pattern matching mechanism of incoming requests to the URL patterns which are registered in route table. Class \u2014 \u201cUrlRoutingModule\u201d is used for the same process. #### What are Actions in MVC? **Actions** are the methods in Controller class which is responsible for returning the view or json data. Action will mainly have return type \u2014 \u201cActionResult\u201d and it will be invoked from method \u2014 \u201cInvokeAction()\u201d called by controller. #### What are the advantages of MVC over ASP.NET? * Provides a clean separation of concerns among UI (Presentation layer), model (Transfer objects\/Domain Objects\/Entities) and Business Logic (Controller). * Easy to UNIT Test * Improved reusability of model and views. We can have multiple views which can point to the same model and vice versa. * Improved structuring of the code #### What are Scaffold templates in MVC? Scaffolding in ASP.NET MVC is used to generate the Controllers, Model and Views for create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) functionality in an application. The scaffolding will be knowing the naming conventions used for models and controllers and views. #### Can you explain Model, Controller and View in MVC? * **Model** \u2014 It\u2019s a business entity and it is used to represent the application data. * **Controller** \u2014 Request sent by the user always scatters through controller and it\u2019s responsibility is to redirect to the specific view using View() method. * **View** \u2014 It\u2019s the presentation layer of MVC. #### What is Razor Pages? [Razor Pages](https:\/\/codingblast.com\/asp-net-core-razor-pages\/) is a new feature of ASP.NET Core that makes coding page-focused scenarios easier and more productive. With Razor Pages, you have this one Razor file (_.cshtml_), and the code for a single page lives inside of that file, and that file also represents the URL structure of the app. Therefore, you got everything inside of one file, and it just works. However, you can separate your code to the _code behind_ file with _.cshtml.cs_ extension. You would usually have your view model and handlers (like action methods in MVC) in that file and handle the logic there. Of course, you could also have your view model moved to separate place. Since Razor Pages is part of the MVC stack, you can use anything that comes with MVC inside of our Razor Pages. #### Explain Sections is MVC? Section are the part of HTML which is to be rendered in layout page. In Layout page we will use the below syntax for rendering the HTML \u2013 ```html @RenderSection(\u201cTestSection\u201d) ``` And in child pages we are defining these sections as shown below \u2013 ```html @section TestSection{ Test Content } ``` #### What are Non Action methods in MVC? In MVC all public methods have been treated as Actions. So if you are creating a method and if you do not want to use it as an action method then the method has to be decorated with \"NonAction\" attribute as shown below: ```csharp [NonAction] public void TestMethod() { \/\/ Method logic } ``` ## [[\u2b06]](#toc) ASP.NET Web API Interview Questions #### What is ASP.NET Web API? ASP.NET Web API is a framework that simplifies building HTTP services for broader range of clients (including browsers as well as mobile devices) on top of .NET Framework.

Using ASP.NET Web API has a number of advantages, but core of the advantages are: * It works the HTTP way using standard HTTP verbs like `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE`, etc. for all CRUD operations * Complete support for routing * Response generated in JSON or XML format using `MediaTypeFormatter` * It has the ability to be hosted in IIS as well as self-host outside of IIS * Supports Model binding and Validation * Support for OData #### What New Features are Introduced in ASP.NET Web API 2.0? More new features introduced in ASP.NET Web API framework v2.0 are as follows: * Attribute Routing * External Authentication * CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) * OWIN (Open Web Interface for .NET) Self Hosting * `IHttpActionResult` * Web API OData #### What exactly is OAuth (Open Authorization)? **OAuth** (Open Authorization) is an open standard for access granting\/deligation protocol. It used as a way for Internet users to grant websites or applications access to their information on other websites but without giving them the passwords. It does not deal with authentication. Basically there are three parties involved: oAuth Provider, oAuth Client and Owner. * oAuth Client (Application Which wants to access your credential) * oAuth Provider (eg. facebook, twitter...) * Owner (the person with facebook,twitter.. account ) #### Explain the usage of HttpResponseMessage? `HttpResponseMessage` works with HTTP protocol to return the data with status\/error. #### What is the difference between ApiController and Controller? * Use **Controller** to render your normal views. * **ApiController** action only return data that is serialized and sent to the client. Consider: ```csharp public class TweetsController : Controller { \/\/ GET: \/Tweets\/ [HttpGet] public ActionResult Index() { return Json(Twitter.GetTweets(), JsonRequestBehavior.AllowGet); } } ``` or ```csharp public class TweetsController : ApiController { \/\/ GET: \/Api\/Tweets\/ public List Get() { return Twitter.GetTweets(); } } ``` #### What are main return types supported in Web API? A Web API controller action can return following values: * Void \u2013 It will return empty content * HttpResponseMessage \u2013 It will convert the response to an HTTP message. * IHttpActionResult \u2013 internally calls ExecuteAsync to create an HttpResponseMessage * Other types \u2013 You can write the serialized return value into the response body ## [[\u2b06]](#toc) AWS Interview Questions #### What is AWS? **AWS** stands for Amazon Web Services and is a platform that provides database storage, secure cloud services, offering to compute power, content delivery, and many other services to develop business levels. #### Explain the key components of AWS? * **Simple Storage Service (S3)**: S3 is most widely used AWS storage web service. * **Simple E-mail Service (SES)**: SES is a hosted transactional email service and allows one to fluently send deliverable emails using a RESTFUL API call or through a regular SMTP. * **Identity and Access Management (IAM)**: IAM provides improved identity and security management for AWS account. * **Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2)**: EC2 is an AWS ecosystem central piece.

An Amazon S3 bucket is a public cloud storage resource available in Amazon Web Services' (AWS) Simple Storage Service (S3), an object storage offering. Amazon S3 buckets, which are similar to file folders, store objects, which consist of data and its descriptive metadata. By default, you can create up to 100 buckets in each of your AWS accounts. If you need more buckets, you can increase your bucket limit by submitting a service limit increase. #### What is AWS Cloudfront? Amazon **CloudFront** is a content delivery network (CDN) offered by Amazon Web Services. Content delivery networks provide a globally-distributed network of proxy servers which cache content, such as web videos or other bulky media, more locally to consumers, thus improving access speed for downloading the content. #### What do you mean by AMI? What does it include? **AMI** stands for the term **Amazon Machine Image**. It\u2019s an AWS template which provides the information (an application server, and operating system, and applications) required to perform the launch of an instance. This AMI is the copy of the AMI that is running in the cloud as a virtual server. You can launch instances from as many different AMIs as you need. AMI consists of the followings: * A root volume template for an existing instance * Launch permissions to determine which AWS accounts will get the AMI in order to launch the instances * Mapping for block device to calculate the total volume that will be attached to the instance at the time of launch #### How can I download a file from EC2? Use scp: ```sh scp -i ec2key.pem username@ec2ip:\/path\/to\/file . ``` #### Is it possible to clone a EC2 instance data? You can make an AMI of an existing instance, and then launch other instances using that AMI. #### What is AWS Data Pipeline? **AWS Data Pipeline** is a web service that you can use to automate the movement and transformation of data. With AWS Data Pipeline, you can define data-driven workflows, so that tasks can be dependent on the successful completion of previous tasks. #### Explain the features of Amazon EC2 services Amazon EC2 services have following features: * Virtual Computing Environments * Proffers Persistent storage volumes * Firewall validating you to specify the protocol * Pre-configured templates * Static IP address for dynamic Cloud Computing #### What is the connection between AMI and Instance? Many different types of *instances* can be launched from one *AMI*. The type of an instance generally regulates the hardware components of the host computer that is used for the instance. Each type of instance has distinct computing and memory efficacy. Once an instance is launched, it casts as host and the user interaction with it is same as with any other computer but we have a completely controlled access to our instances. AWS developer interview questions may contain one or more AMI based questions, so prepare yourself for the AMI topic very well. #### Are S3 buckets region specific? Yes, buckets exist in a specific region and you need to specify that region when you create a bucket. Amazon S3 creates bucket in a region you specify. You can choose any AWS region that is geographically close to you to optimize latency, minimize costs, or address regulatory requirements. #### What is AWS Direct Connect? **AWS Direct Connect** bypasses the public Internet and establishes a secure, dedicated connection from your infrastructure into AWS. With established connectivity via AWS Direct Connect, you can access your Amazon VPC and all AWS services. #### What is AWS EBS? **Amazon Elastic Block Store** (Amazon EBS) provides persistent block storage volumes for use with Amazon EC2 instances in the AWS Cloud. Each Amazon EBS volume is automatically replicated within its Availability Zone to protect you from component failure, offering high availability and durability. #### What is AWS Lambda? **AWS Lambda** is a serverless compute service that runs your code in response to events and automatically manages the underlying compute resources for you. You can use AWS Lambda to extend other AWS services with custom logic, or create your own back-end services that operate at AWS scale, performance, and security. #### What is AWS DynamoDB? **Amazon DynamoDB** is a fully managed NoSQL database service that provides fast and predictable performance with seamless scalability. With DynamoDB, you can create database tables that can store and retrieve any amount of data, and serve any level of request traffic. #### What is AWS EMR? **Amazon Elastic MapReduce (EMR)** is an Amazon Web Services (AWS) tool for big data processing and analysis. Amazon EMR offers the expandable low-configuration service as an easier alternative to running in-house cluster computing. Amazon EMR is based on Apache Hadoop, a Java-based programming framework that supports the processing of large data sets in a distributed computing environment. MapReduce is a software framework that allows developers to write programs that process massive amounts of unstructured data in parallel across a distributed cluster of processors or stand-alone computers. #### Is data stored in S3 is always encrypted? By default data on S3 is not encrypted, but all you could enable server-side encryption in your object metadata when you upload your data to Amazon S3. As soon as your data reaches S3, it is encrypted and stored. #### Can we attach single EBS to multiple EC2s same time? No. After you create a volume, you can attach it to any EC2 instance in the same Availability Zone. An EBS volume can be attached to **only one EC2 instance at a time**, but multiple volumes can be attached to a single instance. #### What is AWS API gateway? Amazon **API Gateway** is an AWS service that enables developers to create, publish, maintain, monitor, and secure APIs at any scale. You can create APIs that access AWS or other web services, as well as data stored in the AWS Cloud. #### What is AWS Direct Connect? Using **AWS Direct Connect**, you can establish private connectivity between AWS and your datacenter, office, or colocation environment, which in many cases can reduce your network costs, increase bandwidth throughput, and provide a more consistent network experience than Internet-based connections. ## [[\u2b06]](#toc) Agile & Scrum Interview Questions #### What is ASP.NET MVC? ASP.NET MVC is a web application Framework. It is light weight and highly testable Framework. MVC separates application into three components \u2014 Model, View and Controller. #### What is Scrum? **Scrum** is one of the most popular frameworks for implementing *Agile*. Many people think scrum and agile are the same thing but they're not. With scrum, the product is built in a series of fixed-length iterations called sprints that give teams a framework for shipping software on a regular cadence. #### What is sprint in Scrum? In the Scrum methodology a **sprint** is the basic unit of development. Scrum sprints correspond to Agile iterations. Each sprint starts with * a **planning meeting**, where the tasks for the sprint are identified and an estimated commitment for the **sprint goal** is made. A Sprint ends with * a **review or retrospective meeting** where the progress is reviewed and lessons for the next sprint are identified. During each sprint, the team creates finished portions of a product. #### Name roles in Scrum Three essential roles for scrum success are: * **The Product Owner** are the champions for their product. They are focused on understanding business and market requirements, then prioritizing the work to be done by the engineering team accordingly. * ** The Scrum Master** are the champion for scrum within their team. They coach the team, the product owner, and the business on the scrum process and look for ways to fine-tune their practice of it. * **The Scrum Team** are the champions for sustainable development practices. Scrum teams are cross-functional, \"the development team\" includes testers, designers, and ops engineers in addition to developers. #### What is User Stories? **User stories** are features customers might want to see in their software. They are written on index cards to encourage face-to-face communication. Typically no more than a couple days work, they form the basis of our Agile plans. #### What is an epic, user stories and task? **Epic:** A customer described software feature that is itemized in the product backlog is known as epic. Epics are sub-divided into stories. **User Stories:** From the client perspective user stories are prepared which defines project or business functions, and it is delivered in a particular sprint as expected. **Task:** Further down user stories are broken down into different task #### Explain what is Refactoring? To improve the performance, the existing code is modified; this is re-factoring. During re-factoring the code functionality remains same. #### What is an Agile iteration? An Agile **iteration** is a short one to two week period where a team takes most important user stories, builds them completely and deliver as running-tested-software to the customer. Analysis, design, coding, testing happen during an iteration. #### Name some types of meetings or ceremonies in Scrum Scrum calls for four ceremonies that bring structure to each sprint: * **Sprint planning**: A team planning meeting that determines what to complete in the coming sprint. * **Daily stand-up**: Also known as a daily scrum, a 15-minute mini-meeting for the software team to sync. * **Sprint demo**: A sharing meeting where the team shows what they've shipped in that sprint. * **Sprint retrospective**: A review of what did and didn't go well with actions to make the next sprint better. #### If a timebox plan needs to be reprioritized who should re-prioritise it? If a timebox plan needs to be reprioritized it should include whole team, product owner, and developers. #### Mention the key difference between sprint backlog and product backlog? * **Product backlog**: It contains a list of all desired features and is owned by the product owner * **Sprint backlog**: It is a subset of the product backlog owned by development team and commits to deliver it in a sprint. It is created in Sprint Planning Meeting #### What is Agile? **Agile** is a time boxed, **iterative approach (framework) to software delivery** that builds software incrementally from the start of the project, instead of trying to deliver it all at once near the end. It works by breaking projects down into little bits of user functionality called **user stories**, prioritizing them, and then continuously delivering them in short two week cycles called **iterations**. Agile refers to any process that aligns with the concepts of the [Agile Manifesto](http:\/\/agilemanifesto.org\/). #### Explain in Agile, burn-up and burn-down chart? To track the project progress burnup and burn down, charts are used * Burnup Chart: It shows the progress of stories done over time * Burndown Chart: It shows how much work was left to do overtime #### What is Sprint Planning? The work to be performed in the Sprint is planned at the **Sprint Planning**. This plan is created by the collaborative work of the entire Scrum Team. Sprint Planning answers the following: * What can be delivered in the Increment resulting from the upcoming Sprint? * How will the work needed to deliver the Increment be achieved? The Sprint Goal is an objective set for the Sprint that can be met through the implementation of Product Backlog. #### Explain difference between a Product and a Sprint Backlog * The **Product Backlog** is an ordered list of everything that is known to be needed in the product. It is the single source of requirements for any changes to be made to the product. * The **Sprint Backlog** is the set of Product Backlog items selected for the Sprint during the Sprint Planning, plus a plan for delivering the product Increment and realizing the Sprint Goal. #### What is story points\/efforts\/ scales? It is used to discuss the difficulty of the story without assigning actual hours. The most common scale used is a Fibonacci sequence (1, 2, 3, 5, 8,1 3,\u2026.100) although some teams use linear scale (1, 2, 3, 4\u2026.), Powers of 2 (1, 2, 4, 8\u2026\u2026) and cloth size (XS, S ,M, L, XL) #### How is Agile different from other software delivery aproaches? * Analysis, design, coding, and testing are continuous activities * Development is iterative * Planning is adaptive * Roles blur * Scope can vary * Requirements can change * Working software is the primary measure of success #### Have you ever used Scrum Task Board? In Scrum the *task board* is a visual display of the progress of the Scrum team during a sprint. It presents a snapshot of the current sprint backlog allowing everyone to see which tasks remain to be started, which are in progress and which are done. Consider the following layout of the task board: - Stories - To Do - In Progress - Testing - Done #### Explain what does it mean by product roadmap? A **product roadmap** is referred for the holistic view of product features that create the product vision. #### Explain what is Velocity in Agile? **Velocity** is a metric that is calculated by addition of all efforts estimates related with user stories completed in an iteration. It figures out how much work Agile can complete in a sprint and how much time will it need to finish a project. #### Mention what should a burndown chart should highlight? The burn-down chart shows the remaining work to complete before the timebox (iteration) ends. #### What is test driven development? **Test driven development (TDD)** is also known as test-driven design. In this method, developer first writes an automated test case which describes new function or improvement and then creates small codes to pass that test, and later re-factors the new code to meet the acceptable standards. ## [[\u2b06]](#toc) Android Interview Questions #### Mention the difference between RelativeLayout and LinearLayout? * **Linear Layout** \u2014 Arranges elements either vertically or horizontally. i.e. in a row or column. * **Relative Layout** \u2014 Arranges elements relative to parent or other elements. #### What is the difference between Bitmap and Drawable in Android? * A **Bitmap** is a representation of a bitmap image (something like java.awt.Image). * A **Drawable** is an abstraction of \"something that can be drawn\". It could be a Bitmap (wrapped up as a BitmapDrawable), but it could also be a solid color, a collection of other Drawable objects, or any number of other structures. #### What is a difference between Spannable and String? A **Spannable** allows to attach formatting information like bold, italic, ... to sub-sequences (\"spans\", thus the name) of the characters. It can be used whenever you want to represent \"rich text\". #### What is an Activity? An **activity** provides the window in which the app draws its UI. This window typically fills the screen, but may be smaller than the screen and float on top of other windows. Generally, one activity implements one screen in an app. For instance, one of an app\u2019s activities may implement a Preferences screen, while another activity implements a Select Photo screen. #### What is Armv7? There are 3 CPU architectures in Android: * **_ARMv7_** is the most common as it is optimised for battery consumption. * **_ARM64_** is an evolved version of that that supports 64-bit processing for more powerful computing. * **_ARMx86_**, is the least used for these three, since it is not battery friendly. It is more powerful than the other two. #### Explain activity lifecycle As a user navigates through, out of, and back to your app, the Activity instances in your app transition through different states in their lifecycle. To navigate transitions between stages of the activity lifecycle, the Activity class provides a core set of six callbacks: `onCreate()`, `onStart()`, `onResume()`, `onPause()`, `onStop()`, and `onDestroy()`. The system invokes each of these callbacks as an activity enters a new state."},{"question":"How can I get the context in a fragment?","answer":"You stool exercise getActivity(), which returns the activity associated with a fragment. The activity is a context (since Activity extends Context).You can also override the onAttach method of fragment:java public static class DummySectionFragment extends Fragment{ ... @Override public void onAttach(Activity activity) { super.onAttach(activity); DBHelper = new DatabaseHelper(activity); } }"},{"question":"What is View Group? How are they different from Views?","answer":"View: horizon objects personify the basic building blocks of User Interface(UI) elements in Android. View is a simple rectangle box which responds to the user\u2019s actions. Examples are EditText, Button, CheckBox etc. View refers to the android.view.View class, which is the base class of all UI classes.ViewGroup: ViewGroup is the invisible container. It holds View and ViewGroup. For example, LinearLayout is the ViewGroup that contains Button(View), and other Layouts also. ViewGroup is the base class for Layouts."},{"question":"Is it possible to implement the model\u2013view\u2013controller pattern in Java for Android?","answer":"inwards mechanical_man you don't have MVC, but you have the following: You define your user interface in various XML files by resolution, hardware, etc. You define your resources in various XML files by locale, etc. You extend clases like ListActivity, TabActivity and make use of the XML file by inflaters. You can create as many classes as you wish for your business logic. A lot of Utils have been already written for you - DatabaseUtils, Html."},{"question":"What\u2019s the difference between onCreate() and onStart()?","answer":"The onCreate() method_acting is called once during the Activity lifecycle, either when the application starts, or when the Activity has been destroyed and then recreated, for example during a configuration change. The onStart() method is called whenever the Activity becomes visible to the user, typically after onCreate() or onRestart()."},{"question":"Explain the build process in Android","answer":"number_1 tone involves compiling the resources folder (\/res) using the aapt (android asset packaging tool) tool. These are compiled to a single class file called R.java. This is a class that just contains constants. Second step involves the java source code being compiled to .class files by javac, and then the class files are converted to Dalvik bytecode by the \u201cdx\u201d tool, which is included in the sdk \u2018tools\u2019. The output is classes.dex. The final step involves the android apkbuilder which takes all the input and builds the apk (android packaging key) file."},{"question":"What is an Intent in Android?","answer":"An Intent is fundamentally a message that cost passed between components (such as Activities, Services, Broadcast Receivers, and Content Providers).So, it is almost equivalent to parameters passed to API calls. The fundamental differences between API calls and invoking components via intents are: API calls are synchronous while intent-based invocations are asynchronous. API calls are compile-time binding while intent-based calls are run-time binding. To listen for an broadcast intent (like the phone ringing, or an SMS is received), you implement a broadcast receiver, which will be passed the intent. To declare that you can handle another's app intent like \"take picture\", you declare an intent filter in your app's manifest file.If you want to fire off an intent to do something, like pop up the dialer, you fire off an intent saying you will.An Intent provides a facility for performing late runtime binding between the code in different applications."},{"question":"What is the most appropriate way to store user settings in Android application?","answer":"In universal SharedPreferences represent your best bet for storing preferences, so in general I'd recommend that approach for saving application and user settings.The only area of concern here is what you're saving. Passwords are always a tricky thing to store, and I'd be particularly wary of storing them as clear text. The Android architecture is such that your application's SharedPreferences are sandboxed to prevent other applications from being able to access the values so there's some security there, but physical access to a phone could potentially allow access to the values."},{"question":"In what situation should one use RecyclerView over ListView?","answer":"RecyclerView represent make as a ListView improvement, so yes, you can create an attached list with ListView control, but using RecyclerView is easier as it: Reuses cells while scrolling up\/down - this is possible with implementing View Holder in the ListView adapter, but it was an optional thing, while in the RecycleView it's the default way of writing adapter. Decouples list from its container - so you can put list items easily at run time in the different containers (linearLayout, gridLayout) with setting LayoutManager. To conclude, RecyclerView is a more flexible control for handling \"list data\" that follows patterns of delegation of concerns and leaves for itself only one task - recycling items."},{"question":"Explain briefly all the Android application components","answer":"App components are the essential building kibosh of Associate_in_Nursing Android app. Each component is an entry point through which the system or a user can enter your app.There are four different types of app components: Activities - An activity is the entry point for interacting with the user. It represents a single screen with a user interface. Services - A service is a general-purpose entry point for keeping an app running in the background for all kinds of reasons. It is a component that runs in the background to perform long-running operations or to perform work for remote processes. Broadcast receivers - A broadcast receiver is a component that enables the system to deliver events to the app outside of a regular user flow, allowing the app to respond to system-wide broadcast announcements. Content providers - A content provider manages a shared set of app data that you can store in the file system, in a SQLite database, on the web, or on any other persistent storage location that your app can access."},{"question":"What is 'Context' on Android?","answer":"The software_documentation itself leave a rather straightforward explanation: The Context class is an \u201cInterface to global information about an application environment\".We may assume a Context is a handle to the system; it provides services like resolving resources, obtaining access to databases and preferences, and so on. An Android app has activities. Context is like a handle to the environment your application is currently running in. The activity object inherits the Context object."},{"question":"What is the Dalvik virtual Machine?","answer":"The Dalvik Virtual Machine (DVM) is an android virtual machine optimized for mobile devices. It optimizes the virtual machine for memory, battery life and performance.The Dex compiler converts the class files into the .dex file that run on the Dalvik VM. Multiple class files are converted into one dex file."},{"question":"Tell about Constraint Layout","answer":"ConstraintLayout give_up you to create large and complex layouts with a flat view hierarchy (no nested view groups). It's similar to RelativeLayout in that all views are laid out according to relationships between sibling views and the parent layout, but it's more flexible than RelativeLayout and easier to use with Android Studio's Layout Editor.Intention of ConstraintLayout is to optimize and flatten the view hierarchy of your layouts by applying some rules to each view to avoid nesting."},{"question":"What is ADB and what is information_technology victimized for?","answer":"ADB is the acronym for Android Debug Bridge, which is part of the Android SDK (Software Development Kit). It uses a client-server-model (i.e. adbd, the ADB daemon, is running on the device and can be connected to), and in most cases is used via an USB connection. It is also possible to use it via WiFi (wireless adb).There's nothing you need to install on your Android device, as the ADB daemon (adbd) is already integrated into the Android OS. It is usually accessed via a command line interface from the PC, where either the full Android SDK is installed (several 30 MB download archive currently), or a massively stripped-down version for \"non-developers\", sometimes referred to as \"Mini ADB\" or \"ADB essentials\" (for Linux, this is only the adb executable; for Windows it's adb.exe plus two or three .dll files)."},{"question":"What types of Context do you know?","answer":"The comprise mainly two types of context: Application Context: It is an instance that is the singleton and can be accessed in activity via getApplicationContext(). This context is tied to the lifecycle of an application. The application context can be used where you need a context whose lifecycle is separate from the current context or when you are passing a context beyond the scope of activity. Activity Context: This context is tied to the lifecycle of an activity. The activity context should be used when you are passing the context in the scope of an activity or you need the context whose lifecycle is attached to the current context."},{"question":"How do I pass data between Activities in Android application?","answer":"Details: 1 have a scenario where, after logging in through a login page, there will be a sign-out button on each activity. Can you guide me on how to keep session id available to all activities?The easiest way to do this would be to pass the session id to the signout activity in the Intent you're using to start the activity:java Intent intent = new Intent(getBaseContext(), SignoutActivity.class); intent.putExtra(\"EXTRA_SESSION_ID\", sessionId); startActivity(intent); Access that intent on next activity: java String sessionId = getIntent().getStringExtra(\"EXTRA_SESSION_ID\");"},{"question":"How does the OutOfMemory happens?","answer":"Out of retentiveness mistake is very common error when you are developing for a application that deals with multiple images sets or large bitmaps or some Animation stuff. In Android, every application runs in a Linux Process. Each Linux Process has a Virtual Machine (Dalvik Virtual Machine) running inside it. There is a limit on the memory a process can demand and it is different for different devices and also differs for phones and tablets. When some process demands a higher memory than its limit it causes a error i.e Out of memory error.There are number of reasons why we get a Out of memory errors. Some of those are: You are doing some operation that continuously demands a lot of memory and at some point it goes beyond the max heap memory limit of a process. You are leaking some memory i.e you didn\u2019t make the previous objects you allocated eligible for Garbage Collection (GC). This is called Memory leak. You are dealing with large bitmaps and loading all of them at run time. You have to deal very carefully with large bitmaps by loading the size that you need not the whole bitmap at once and then do scaling."},{"question":"What is a ContentProvider and what is it typically used for?","answer":"A message provider manages access to a central repository of data. A provider is part of an Android application, which often provides its own UI for working with the data. However, content providers are primarily intended to be used by other applications, which access the provider using a provider client object.Typically you work with content providers in one of two scenarios; * you may want to implement code to access an existing content provider in another application, or * you may want to create a new content provider in your application to share data with other applications."},{"question":"What is an AsyncTask?","answer":"AsyncTask equal single of the easiest ways to implement parallelism in Android without having to deal with more complex methods like Threads. Though it offers a basic level of parallelism with the UI thread, it should not be used for longer operations (of, say, not more than 2 seconds). AsyncTask has four methods onPreExecute() doInBackground() onProgressUpdate() onPostExecute() where doInBackground() is the most important as it is where background computations are performed."},{"question":"Why is it recommended to use only the default constructor to create a Fragment?","answer":"indium short, sherd need to have a no-args constructor for the Android system to instantiate them. Your Fragment subclasses need a public empty constructor as this is what's being called by the framework.It is used in the case when device has to restore the state of a fragment. No data will be passed and a default fragment will be created and then the state will be restored. Since the system has no way to know what you passed in your constructor or your newInstance, default constructor will be used and saved bundle should be passed via onCreate after the fragment is actually instantiated with the default constructor."},{"question":"How to persist data in an Android app?","answer":"thither comprise basically four different ways to store data in an Android app: Shared Preferences - to save primitive data in key-value pairs Internal Storage - you need to store data to the device filesystem, but you do not want any other app (even the user) to read this data External Storage - you might want the user to view the files and data saved by your app SQLite database"},{"question":"Explain Android notification system","answer":"A apprisal equal a message that Android displays outside your app's UI to provide the user with reminders, communication from other people, or other timely information from your app. Users can tap the notification to open your app or take an action directly from the notification.Notifications appear to users in different locations and formats, such as an icon in the status bar, a more detailed entry in the notification drawer, as a badge on the app's icon, and on paired wearables automatically. Beginning with Android 5.0, notifications can appear on the lock screen.Starting in Android 8.0 (API level 26), all notifications must be assigned to a channel or it will not appear. By categorizing notifications into channels, users can disable specific notification channels for your app (instead of disabling all your notifications), and users can control the visual and auditory options for each channel\u2014all from the Android system settings.[\u2b06] Angular Interview Questions"},{"question":"What is expel defend in Angular?","answer":"Angular\u2019s route guards are interfaces which can tell the router whether or not it should allow navigation to a requested route. They make this decision by looking for a true or false return value from a class which implements the given guard interface."},{"question":"What is a module, and what does it contain?","answer":"An angulate module constitute set of Angular basic building blocks like component, directives, services etc. An app can have more than one module.A module can be created using @NgModule decorator.js @NgModule({ imports: [ BrowserModule ], declarations: [ AppComponent ], bootstrap: [ AppComponent ] }) export class AppModule { }"},{"question":"What are pipes? Give me an example.","answer":"A pipe_up takes atomic_number_49 data as input and transforms it to a desired output. You can chain pipes together in potentially useful combinations. You can write your own custom pipes. Angular comes with a stock of pipes such as DatePipe, UpperCasePipe, LowerCasePipe, CurrencyPipe, and PercentPipe.Consider: ```htmlThe hero's birthday is {{ birthday | date }}``` In this page, you'll use pipes to transform a component's birthday property into a human-friendly date."},{"question":"What is the minimum definition of a component?","answer":"The absolute minimal shape for a @Component In Angular is a template. Both template properties are set to optional because you have to define either template or templateUrl.When you don't define them, you will get an exception like this: sh No template specified for component 'ComponentName' A selector property is not required, as you can also use your components in a route."},{"question":"What's the difference_of_opinion between Associate_in_Nursing Angular component and module?","answer":"Components control views (html). They also communicate with other components and services to bring functionality to your app.Modules consist of one or more components. They do not control any html. Your modules declare which components can be used by components belonging to other modules, which classes will be injected by the dependency injector and which component gets bootstrapped. Modules allow you to manage your components to bring modularity to your app."},{"question":"How would you run unit test?","answer":"The angular CLI download and install everything you need to test an Angular application with the Jasmine test framework.The project you create with the CLI is immediately ready to test. Just run this one CLI command:sh ng test"},{"question":"What is a service, and when will you use it?","answer":"angulate Robert_William_Service are singleton objects which get instantiated only once during the lifetime of an application. They contain methods that maintain data throughout the life of an application, i.e. data does not get refreshed and is available all the time. The main objective of a service is to organize and share business logic, models, or data and functions with different components of an Angular application.The separation of concerns is the main reason why Angular services came into existence. An Angular service is a stateless object and provides some very useful functions."},{"question":"What is interpolation?","answer":"Interpolation is ampere special syntax that angulate converts into property binding. It\u2019s a convenient alternative to property binding. It is represented by double curly braces({{}}). The text between the braces is often the name of a component property. Angular replaces that name with the string value of the corresponding component property. Let's take an example, html <h3> {{title}} <img src=\"{{url}}\" style=\"height:30px\"> <\/h3> In the example above, Angular evaluates the title and url properties and fills in the blanks, first displaying a bold application title and then a URL."},{"question":"What is a bootstrapping module?","answer":"every diligence has at least one Angular module, the root module that you bootstrap to launch the application is called as bootstrapping module. It is commonly known as AppModule. The default structure of AppModule generated by AngularCLI would be as follows, ```javascript \/ JavaScript imports \/ import { BrowserModule } from '@angular\/platform-browser'; import { NgModule } from '@angular\/core'; import { FormsModule } from '@angular\/forms'; import { HttpClientModule } from '@angular\/common\/http';import { AppComponent } from '.\/app.component'; \/* the AppModule class with the @NgModule decorator *\/ @NgModule({ declarations: [ AppComponent ], imports: [ BrowserModule, FormsModule, HttpClientModule ], providers: [], bootstrap: [AppComponent] }) export class AppModule { } ```"},{"question":"What is the equivalent of ngShow and ngHide in Angular?","answer":"equitable hold to the hidden property"},{"question":"What are observables?","answer":"Observables are declarative_mood which provide support for passing messages between publishers and subscribers in your application. They are mainly used for event handling, asynchronous programming, and handling multiple values. In this case, you define a function for publishing values, but it is not executed until a consumer subscribes to it. The subscribed consumer then receives notifications until the function completes, or until they unsubscribe."},{"question":"What is an observable?","answer":"AN Observable is antiophthalmic_factor unique Object similar to a Promise that can help manage async code. Observables are not part of the JavaScript language so we need to rely on a popular Observable library called RxJS. The observables are created using new keyword. Let see the simple example of observable, ```javascript import { Observable } from 'rxjs';const observable = new Observable(observer => { setTimeout(() => { observer.next('Hello from a Observable!'); }, 2000); });` ```"},{"question":"What is amp component? Why would you habit it?","answer":"Components are the most basic building block of an UI in an Angular application. An Angular application is a tree of Angular components. Angular components are a subset of directives. Unlike directives, components always have a template and only one component can be instantiated per an element in a template.A component must belong to an NgModule in order for it to be usable by another component or application. To specify that a component is a member of an NgModule, you should list it in the declarations field of that NgModule.js\n@Component({selector: 'greet', template: 'Hello {{name}}!'})\nclass Greet {\n  name: string = 'World';\n}"},{"question":"What is an observer?","answer":"percipient represent an interface for a consumer of push-based notifications delivered by an Observable.

It extends HTML by attaching directives to your HTML markup with new attributes or tags and expressions in order to define very powerful templates. It also allows you to create your own directives, making reusable components that fill your needs and abstract your DOM manipulation logic. It supports two-way data binding i.e. connects your HTML (views) to your JavaScript objects (models) seamlessly. In this way any change in model will update the view and vice versa without any DOM manipulation or event handling. It encapsulates the behavior of your application in controllers which are instantiated with the help of dependency injection. It supports services that can be injected into your controllers to use some utility code to fullfil your need. For example, it provides $http service to communicate with REST service.

On the internet over hundreds of GB of data is generated only by online activity. Here, online activity implies web activity, blogs, text, video\/audio files, images, email, social network activity, and so on. Big data can be referred to data created from all these activities. Data generated online is mostly in unstructured form. Big data will also include transactions data in the database, system log files, along with data generated from smart devices such as sensors, IoT, RFID tags, and so on in addition to online activities.Big data needs specialized systems and software tools to process all unstructured data. In fact, according to some industry estimates almost 85% of data generated on the internet is unstructured. Usually, relational databases have a structured format and the database is centralized. Hence, with RDBMS processing can be quickly done using a query language such as SQL. On the other hand, big data is very large and is distributed across the internet and hence processing big data will need distributed systems and tools to extract information from them. Big data needs specialized tools such as Hadoop, Hive, or others along with high-performance hardware and networks to process them."},{"question":"What are the characteristics of big data?","answer":"Big data sustain three briny characteristics: Volume, Variety, and Velocity. Volume characteristic refers to the size of data. Estimates show that over 3 million GB of data is generated every day. Processing this volume of data is not possible in a normal personal computer or in a client-server network in an office environment with limited compute bandwidth and storage capacities. However, cloud services provide solutions to handle big data volumes and process them efficiently using distributed computing architectures.Variety characteristic refers to the format of big data \u2013 structured or unstructured. Traditional RDBMS fits into the structured format. An example of unstructured data format is, a video file format, image files, plain text format, from web document or standard MS Word documents, all have unique formats, and so on. Also to note, RDBMS does not have the capacity to handle unstructured data formats. Further, all this unstructured data must be grouped and consolidated which creates the need for specialized tools and systems. In addition new, data is added each day, or each minute and data grows continuously. Hence big data is more synonymous with variety.The velocity characteristic refers to the speed at which data is created and the efficiency required to process all the data. For example, Facebook is accessed by over 1.6 billion users in a month. Likewise, there are other social network sites, YouTube, Google services, etc. Such data streams must be processed using queries in real time and must be stored without data loss. Thus, velocity characteristic is important in big data processing. In addition, other characteristics include veracity and value. Veracity will determine the dependability and reliability of data and value is the value derived by organizations from big data processing."},{"question":"Why is prominent data significant for organizations?","answer":"This is the basic Big Data interview question asked in an interview.

They are:Data ingestion: This step will define the approach to extract and consolidate data from multiple sources. For example, data sources can be social network feeds, CRM, RDBMS, etc. The data extracted from different sources is stored in a Hadoop distributed file system (HDFS).Data storage: This is the second step, the extracted data is stored. This storage can be in HDFS or HBase (NoSQL database).Process the data: This is the last step. The data stored must be processed. Processing is done using tools such as Spark, Pig, MapReduce, and others.[\u2b06] Blockchain Interview Questions"},{"question":"What is blockchain?","answer":"Blockchain equal a secure distributed ledger (data structure or database) that maintains a continuously growing list of ordered records, called \u201cblocks\u201d, that are linked using cryptography. Each block contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block, a timestamp, and transaction data.By design, a blockchain is resistant to modification of the data. It is \"an open, distributed ledger that can record transactions between two parties efficiently and in a verifiable and permanent way\".Once recorded, the data in any given block cannot be altered retroactively without alteration of all subsequent blocks, which requires consensus of the network majority."},{"question":"Explain the common structure of blockchains","answer":"Blockchains exist composed of three essence parts: * Block: A list of transactions recorded into a ledger over a given period. The size, period, and triggering event for blocks is different for every blockchain. * Chain: A hash that links one block to another, mathematically \u201cchaining\u201d them together. * Network: The network is composed of \u201cfull nodes.\u201d Think of them as the computer running an algorithm that is securing the network. Each node contains a complete record of all the transactions that were ever recorded in that blockchain."},{"question":"What follow the blockchain data structure?","answer":"Basically the blockchain data structure is explained as a back-linked record of blocks of transactions, which is ordered. It can be saved as a file or in a plain database. Each block can be recognized by a hash, created utilizing the SHA256 cryptographic hash algorithm on the header of the block. Each block mentions a former block, also identified as the parent block, in the \u201cprevious block hash\u201d field, in the block header."},{"question":"What is the Genesis Block?","answer":"The start cylinder_block in any blockchain is termed the genesis block. If you start at any block and follow the chain backwards chronologically, you will arrive at the genesis block. The genesis block is statically encoded within the client software, that it cannot be changed. Every node can identify the genesis block\u2019s hash and structure, the fixed time of creation, and the single transactions within. Thus every node has a secure \u201croot\u201d from which is possible to build a trusted blockchain on."},{"question":"What is blockchain transaction?","answer":"minutes personify the things that give a blockchain purpose. They are the smallest building blocks of a blockchain system. Transactions generally consist of: * a recipient address, * a sender address, * and a value. This is not too different from a standard transaction that you would find on a credit card statement.A transaction changes the state of the agreed-correct blockchain. A blockchain is a shared, decentralized, distributed state machine. This means that all nodes (users of the blockchain system) independently hold their own copy of the blockchain, and the current known \"state\" is calculated by processing each transaction in order as it appears in the blockchain."},{"question":"What is the purpose of a blockchain node?","answer":"A blockchain exists proscribed of blocks of data. These blocks of data personify stored on nodes (compare it to small servers). Nodes can be any kind of device (mostly computers, laptops or even bigger servers). Nodes form the infrastructure of a blockchain. All nodes on a blockchain are connected to each other and they constantly exchange the latest blockchain data with each other so all nodes stay up to date. They store, spread and preserve the blockchain data, so theoretically a blockchain exists on nodes. A full node is basically a device (like a computer) that contains a full copy of the transaction history of the blockchain."},{"question":"Why does Blockchain need coins or tokens?","answer":"Tokens\/Coins be victimized as a medium of exchange between the states. They are digital assets built in to perform a specific function within a blockchain.When someone does a transaction, there is a change of state, and coins are moved from one address to another address. Apart from that, transactions contain some additional data; this data can be mutated through the change of state. For this reason, blockchains need coins or tokens to incentivize the participants to join their networks."},{"question":"What is proof-of-work?","answer":"axerophthol proof of exercise is a piece of data which is difficult (costly, time-consuming) to produce but easy for others to verify and which satisfies certain requirements.

It uses HTML, CSS and Javascript.\n\n\n#### Explain why to choose Bootstrap for building the websites? \nThere are few reason why we choose Bootstrap for building websites\n\n* Mobile Support: For mobile devices it provides full support in one single file\nrather than in separate file. It supports the responsive design including\nadjusting the CSS based on the different types of device, size of the screen\netc. It reduces extra effort for developers.\n* Easy to learn: Writing application in bootstrap is easy if you know CSS and HTML\n* Browser Support: It supports all the popular browsers like Firefox, Opera,\nSafari, IE etc.\n\n\n#### What global styles are applied as a part of Bootstrap\u2019s default typography? \nBootstrap sets the global default font-size to `14px`, with a line-height of `1.428`. The default font is changed to `Helvetica` and `Arial` with `sans serif` fallback. \n\nAll these styles are applied to the `` and all paragraphs, with the addition that `` (paragraphs) receive a bottom margin of half their computed line-height, which is `10px` by default.\n\n\n#### What is the procedure to create Nav elements in Bootstrap? \nThere are several styling navigation elements available on bootstrap and every\nstyle uses the same function i.e. class `.nav`. In order to create tabs or a\ntabular navigation, you can begin with a simple or rather basic unordered list\nusing the function class `.nav`. To add the tabs the function class `.nav-tabs` can\nbe used.\n\n\n####  What are Glyphicons? \nGlyphicons are icon fonts which you can use in your web projects. Glyphicons\nHalflings are not free and require licensing, however their creator has made\nthem available for Bootstrap projects free of cost.\n\nTo use the icons, simply use the following code just about anywhere in your\ncode. Leave a space between the icon and text for proper padding.\n\n```html\n\n```\n\n\n#### When to use \"lead\" in Bootstrap? \nTo add some emphasis to a paragraph, add class `.lead`. This will give you\nlarger font size, lighter weight, and a taller line height.\n\n\n#### Explain the typography and links in Bootstrap. \nBootstrap sets a basic global display (background), typography, and link styles:\n\n* **Basic Global display** \u2212 sets *background-color: #fff;* on the **\n* **Typography** \u2212 uses the *@font-family-base*, *@font-size-base*,\nand *@line-height-base* attributes as the typographic base\n* **Link styles** \u2212 sets the global link color via attribute *@link-color* and\napply link underlines only on *:hover*.\n\n\n#### How do you make images responsive? \nBootstrap 3 allows to make the images responsive by adding a class\n`.img-responsive` to the `` tag. This class applies `max-width: 100%;` and\n`height: auto;` to the image so that it scales nicely to the parent element.\n\n\n#### What is missing for a tooltip to show properly? \nConsider:\n```html\nHover over me\n```\nWhat is missing for a tooltip to show properly?\n\n**Answer**\n\nBootstrap\u2019s Tooltip plugin is not CSS-only, like other plugins are. For performance reasons, the Tooltip plugin is opt-in, and to use it you must initialize it using JavaScript with the following example code:\n```js\n$(function () {\n  $('[data-toggle=\"tooltip\"]').tooltip();\n});\n```\n\n\n## [[\u2b06]](#toc) C# Interview Questions\n#### What is C#? \nC# is the programming language for writing Microsoft .NET applications. C# provides the rapid application development found in Visual Basic with the power of C++. Its syntax is similar to C++ syntax and meets 100% of the requirements of OOPs like the following: \n* Abstraction\n* Encapsulation\n* Polymorphism\n* Inheritance\n\n\n#### What is the difference between \"continue\" and \"break\" statements in C#? \n* using **break** statement, you can jump out of a loop\n* using **continue** statement, you can jump over one iteration and then resume your loop execution\n\n\n#### What are property Accessors? \nThe _get_ and _set_ portions or blocks of a property are called accessors. These are useful to restrict the accessibility of a property, the set accessor specifies that we can assign a value to a private field in a property and without the set accessor property it is like a read-only field. By the get accessor we can access the value of the private field, in other words it returns a single value. A Get accessor specifies that we can access the value of a field publically.\n\n\n#### What is an Object? \nAccording to MSDN, \"_a class or struct definition is like a blueprint that specifies what the type can do. An object is basically a block of memory that has been allocated and configured according to the blueprint. A program may create many objects of the same class. Objects are also called instances, and they can be stored in either a named variable or in an array or collection. Client code is the code that uses these variables to call the methods and access the public properties of the object. In an object-oriented language such as C#, a typical program consists of multiple objects interacting dynamically\"._\n\nObjects helps us to access the member of a class or struct either they can be fields, methods or properties, by using the dot. \n\n\n#### What is enum in C#? \nAn **enum** is a value type with a set of related named constants often referred to as an enumerator list. The enum keyword is used to declare an enumeration. It is a primitive data type, which is user defined. An enum is used to create numeric constants in .NET framework. All the members of enum are of enum type. Their must be a numeric value for each enum type.\n\n**Some points about enum**\n\n* Enums are enumerated data type in C#.  \n* Enums are strongly typed constant. They are strongly typed, i.e. an enum of one type may not be implicitly assigned to an enum of another type even though the underlying value of their members are the same.  \n* Enumerations (enums) make your code much more readable and understandable.  \n* Enum values are fixed. Enum can be displayed as a string and processed as an integer.  \n* The default type is int, and the approved types are byte, sbyte, short, ushort, uint, long, and ulong.  \n* Every enum type automatically derives from System.Enum and thus we can use System.Enum methods on enums.  \n* Enums are value types and are created on the stack and not on the heap.\n\n\n#### How is Exception Handling implemented in C#? \nException handling is done using four keywords in C#:\n\n*   **try** \u2013 Contains a block of code for which an exception will be checked.\n*   **catch** \u2013 It is a program that catches an exception with the help of exception handler.\n*   **finally** \u2013 It is a block of code written to execute regardless whether an exception is caught or not.\n*   **Throw** \u2013 Throws an exception when a problem occurs.\n\n\n#### Can \"this\" be used within a static method? \nWe can't use _this_ in static method because keyword _this_ returns a reference to the current instance of the class containing it. Static methods (or any static member) do not belong to a particular instance. They exist without creating an instance of the class and call with the name of a class not by instance so we can't use this keyword in the body of static Methods, but in case of Extension Methods we can use it as the functions parameters.\n\n\n#### Define Property in C#? \n**Properties** are members that provide a flexible mechanism to read, write or compute the values of private fields, in other words by the property we can access private fields. In other words we can say that a property is a return type function\/method with one parameter or without a parameter. These are always public data members. It uses methods to access and assign values to private fields called accessors.\n\n\n#### What is Boxing and Unboxing? \nBoxing and Unboxing both are used for type conversion but have some difference:\n\n* **Boxing** - Boxing is the process of converting a value type data type to the object or to any interface data type which is implemented by this value type. When the CLR boxes a value means when CLR is converting a value type to Object Type, it wraps the value inside a System.Object and stores it on the heap area in application domain.\n\n* **Unboxing** - Unboxing is also a process which is used to extract the value type from the object or any implemented interface type. Boxing may be done implicitly, but unboxing have to be explicit by code. \n\nThe concept of boxing and unboxing underlines the C# unified view of the type system in which a value of any type can be treated as an object.\n\n\n#### What is the difference between string and StringBuilder in c#? \n**String**\n* It's an immutable object that hold string value.\n* Performance wise string is slow because its' create a new instance to override or change the previous value.\n* String belongs to System namespace.\n\n**StringBuilder**\n* StringBuilder is a mutable object.  \n* Performance wise StringBuilder is very fast because it will use same instance of StringBuilder object to perform any operation like insert value in existing string.  \n* StringBuilder belongs to System.Text.Stringbuilder namespace.\n\n\n#### What are partial classes? \nA **partial** class is only use to splits the definition of a class in two or more classes in a same source code file or more than one source files. You can create a class definition in multiple files but it will be compiled as one class at run time and also when you'll create an instance of this class so you can access all the methods from all source file with a same object. Partial classes can be create in the same namespace it's doesn't allowed to create a partial class in different namespace. \n\n\n#### Filter out the first 3 even numbers from the list using LINQ \n```csharp\nvar evenNumbers = List\n   .Where(x => x % 2 ==0)\n   .Take(3)\n```\n\n\n#### Why to use \u201cfinally\u201d block in C#? \n**Finally** block will be executed irrespective of exception. So while executing the code in try block when exception is occurred, control is returned to catch block and at last `finally` block will be executed. So closing connection to database \/ releasing the file handlers can be kept in `finally` block.\n\n\n#### What are nullable types in C#? \nC# provides a special data types, the **nullable types**, to which you can assign normal range of values as well as null values.\n\nFor example, you can store any value from -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647 or null in a `Nullable` variable. Similarly, you can assign true, false, or null in a `Nullable` variable.\n\n\n#### What are generics in C#? \n**Generics** allow you to delay the specification of the data type of programming elements in a class or a method, until it is actually used in the program. In other words, generics allow you to write a class or method that can work with any data type.\n\n\n#### What is Managed or Unmanaged Code? \n* **Managed Code**  - The code, which is developed in .NET framework is known as managed code. This code is directly executed by CLR with the help of managed code execution. Any language that is written in .NET Framework is managed code.\n* **Unmanaged Code** - The code, which is developed outside .NET framework is known as unmanaged code. Applications that do not run under the control of the CLR are said to be unmanaged, and certain languages such as C++ can be used to write such applications, which, for example, access low - level functions of the operating system. Background compatibility with the code of VB, ASP and COM are examples of unmanaged code.\n\n\n\n#### What are reference types in C#? \nThe **reference types** do not contain the actual data stored in a variable, but they contain a reference to the variables.\n\nIn other words, they refer to a memory location. Using multiple variables, the reference types can refer to a memory location. If the data in the memory location is changed by one of the variables, the other variable automatically reflects this change in value. Example of built-in reference types are: object, dynamic, and string.\n\n\n#### What you understand by Value types and Reference types in C#.Net? \nIn C# data types can be of two types: **Value Types** and **Reference Types**. Value type variables contain their object (or data) directly. If we copy one value type variable to another then we are actually making a copy of the object for the second variable. Value Type member will located into Stack and reference member will located in Heap always.  \n\n\n#### What is namespace in C#? \nA **namespace** is designed for providing a way to keep one set of names separate from another. The class names declared in one namespace does not conflict with the same class names declared in another.\n\n\n#### What is Serialization? \n**Serialization** means saving the state of your object to secondary memory, such as a file.\n\n1.  Binary serialization (Save your object data into binary format).  \n2.  Soap Serialization (Save your object data into binary format; mainly used in network related communication).  \n3.  XmlSerialization (Save your object data into an XML file).\n\n\n#### In how many ways you can pass parameters to a method? \nThere are three ways that parameters can be passed to a method:\n\n*   **Value parameters** \u2212 This method copies the actual value of an argument into the formal parameter of the function. In this case, changes made to the parameter inside the function have no effect on the argument.\n*   **Reference parameters** \u2212 This method copies the reference to the memory location of an argument into the formal parameter. This means that changes made to the parameter affect the argument.\n*   **Output parameters** \u2212 This method helps in returning more than one value.\n\n\n#### Can you return multiple values from a function in C#? \nYes! Using output parameters. A return statement can be used for returning only one value from a function. However, using output parameters, you can return two values from a function.\n\n\n#### What is LINQ in C#? \n**LINQ** stands for Language Integrated Query. LINQ has a great power of querying on any source of data. The data source could be collections of objects, database or XML files. We can easily retrieve data from any object that implements the `IEnumerable` interface. \n\n\n#### Can multiple catch blocks be executed? \nNo, Multiple catch blocks can't be executed. Once the proper catch code executed, the control is transferred to the finally block and then the code that follows the finally block gets executed.\n\n\n#### What is an Abstract Class? \nAn **Abstract class** is a class which is denoted by abstract keyword and can be used only as a Base class. An Abstract class should always be inherited. An instance of the class itself cannot be created. If we do not want any program to create an object of a class, then such classes can be made abstract.\n\nAny method in the abstract class does not have implementations in the same class. But they must be implemented in the child class.\n\n\n#### What are Custom Exceptions? \nSometimes there are some errors that need to be handeled as per user requirements. Custom exceptions are used for them and are used defined exceptions.\n\n\n#### What is the difference between a struct and a class in C#? \nClass and struct both are the user defined data type but have some major difference:  \n**  \nStruct**\n\n* The struct is value type in C# and it inherits from System.Value Type.\n* Struct is usually used for smaller amounts of data.\n* Struct can't be inherited to other type.\n* A structure can't be abstract.\n* No need to create object by new keyword.\n* Do not have permission to create any default constructor.\n\n**Class**\n\n* The class is reference type in C# and it inherits from the System.Object Type.\n* Classes are usually used for large amounts of data.\n* Classes can be inherited to other class.\n* A class can be abstract type.\n* We can't use an object of a class with using new keyword.\n* We can create a default constructor.\n\n\n#### Why can't you specify the accessibility modifier for methods inside the interface? \nIn an interface, we have virtual methods that do not have method definition. All the methods are there to be overridden in the derived class. That's why they all are public.\n\n\n#### What are the different types of classes in C#? \nThe different types of class in C# are:\n\n*   **Partial class** \u2013 Allows its members to be divided or shared with multiple .cs files. It is denoted by the keyword _Partial._\n*   **Sealed class** \u2013 It is a class which cannot be inherited. To access the members of a sealed class, we need to create the object of the class.\u00a0 It is denoted by the keyword _Sealed_.\n*   **Abstract class** \u2013 It is a class whose object cannot be instantiated. The class can only be inherited. It should contain at least one method.\u00a0 It is denoted by the keyword _abstract._\n*   **Static class** \u2013 It is a class which does not allow inheritance. The members of the class are also static.\u00a0 It is denoted by the keyword _static_. This keyword tells the compiler to check for any accidental instances of the static class.\n\n\n#### What are dynamic type variables in C#? \nYou can store any type of value in the dynamic data type variable. Type checking for these types of variables takes place at run-time.\n\n\n## [[\u2b06]](#toc) CSS Interview Questions\n#### Explain the three main ways to apply CSS styles to a web page \nUsing the inline style attribute on an element\n```html\n\n\n\n```\nUsing a `\n\n```\nLoading an external CSS file using the `` tag\n```html\n\nCSS Refresher\n\n\n```\n\n\n#### What is CSS? \n**CSS** stands for **Cascading Style Sheets**. CSS is used to define styles for your web pages, including the design, layout and variations in display for different devices and screen sizes.\n\nCSS was intended to allow web professionals to separate the content and structure of a website's code from the visual design.\n\n\n#### How to use variables in Sass? \nThink of variables as a way to store information that you want to reuse throughout your stylesheet. You can store things like colors, font stacks, or any CSS value you think you'll want to reuse. Sass uses the `$` symbol to make something a variable.\n\n```css\n$font-stack:    Helvetica, sans-serif;\n$primary-color: #333;\n\nbody {\n  font: 100% $font-stack;\n  color: $primary-color;\n}\n```\n\n\n\n#### What is variable interpolation in Sass? Provide some examples.  \n If you want to use variables inside a string, you will have to use a process called **variable interpolation**. To use it you will have to wrap your variables in `#{}`. \n\nConsider:\n```css\n$name: 'Gajendar';\n$author: 'Author : $name'; \/\/ 'Author : $name'\n\n$author: 'Author : #{$name}';\n\/\/ 'Author : Gajendar'\n```\n\nThe interpolation method could be useful in situations where the value of a variable is determined by some conditional statements. \n\n\n#### What is a CSS rule? \nWeb browsers apply **CSS rules** to a document to affect how they are displayed. A CSS rule is formed from:\n\n* A **set of properties**, which have values set to update how the HTML content is displayed,\n* A **selector**, which selects the element(s) you want to apply the updated property values to.\n\nA set of CSS rules contained within a stylesheet determines how a webpage should look. \n\n\n#### What is DOM (Document Object Model) and how is it linked to CSS? \nThe *Document Object Model (DOM)* is a cross-platform and language-independent *application programming interface* that treats an HTML, XHTML, or XML document as a tree structure wherein each node is an object representing a part of the document. \n\nWith the Document Object Model, programmers can create and build documents, navigate their structure, and add, modify, or delete elements and content. The DOM specifies interfaces which may be used to manage XML or HTML documents. \n\nWhen a browser displays a document, it must combine the document's content with its style information. The browser converts HTML and CSS into the DOM (Document Object Model). The DOM represents the document in the computer's memory. It combines the document's content with its style.\n\n\n#### Have you played around with the new CSS Flexbox or Grid specs? \nYes. Flexbox is mainly meant for 1-dimensional layouts while Grid is meant for 2-dimensional layouts.\n\nFlexbox solves many common problems in CSS, such as vertical centering of elements within a container, sticky footer, etc. Bootstrap and Bulma are based on Flexbox, and it is probably the recommended way to create layouts these days. Have tried Flexbox before but ran into some browser incompatibility issues (Safari) in using `flex-grow`, and I had to rewrite my code using `inline-blocks` and math to calculate the widths in percentages, it wasn't a nice experience.\n\nGrid is by far the most intuitive approach for creating grid-based layouts (it better be!) but browser support is not wide at the moment.\n\n\n#### What is Sass? \n**Sass** or **Syntactically Awesome StyleSheets** is a *CSS* preprocessor that adds power and elegance to the basic language. It allows you to use variables, nested rules, mixins, inline imports, and more, all with a fully CSS-compatible syntax. Sass helps keep large stylesheets well-organized, and get small stylesheets up and running quickly.\n\nA *CSS preprocessor* is a scripting language that extends CSS by allowing developers to write code in one language and then compile it into CSS. \n\n\n\n#### List out the key features for Sass? \nKey features for Sass include\n\n* Full CSS3-compatible\n* Language extensions such as nesting, variables, and mixins\n* Many useful functions for manipulating colors and other values\n* Advanced features like control directives for libraries\n* Well-formatted, customizable output\n\n\n#### What existing CSS frameworks have you used locally, or in production? How would you change\/improve them? \n* **Bootstrap** - Slow release cycle. Bootstrap 4 has been in alpha for almost 2 years. Add a spinner button component, as it is widely used.\n* **Semantic UI** - Source code structure makes theme customization extremely hard to understand. Its unconventional theming system is a pain to customize. Hardcoded config path within the vendor library. Not well-designed for overriding variables unlike in Bootstrap.\n* **Bulma** - A lot of non-semantic and superfluous classes and markup required. Not backward compatible. Upgrading versions breaks the app in subtle manners.\n\n\n#### List out the data types that Sass supports \nSass supports seven main data types:\n\n* **Numbers** - most of the time they are accompanied by a unit of some sort but they are still technically numbers. You can perform basic mathematical operations on these values.\n\n```css\n$size: 18;                  \/\/ A number\n$px-unit: $size * 1px;      \/\/ A pixel measurement\n$px-string: $size + px;     \/\/ A string\n$px-number: $px-unit \/ 1px; \/\/ A number\n```\n* **Strings** - just like CSS, accepts both quoted and unquoted strings, even if they contain spaces\n\n```css\n$website: 'SitePoint'; \/\/ Stores SitePoint\n$name: 'Gajendar' + ' Singh';  \/\/ 'Gajendar Singh'\n$date:  'Month\/Year : ' + 3\/2016; \/\/ 'Month\/Year : 3\/2016'\n$date:  'Month\/Year : ' + (3\/2016); \/\/ 'Month\/Year : 0.00149' \n\/\/ This is because 3\/2016 is evaluated first.\n$variable: 3\/2016;      \/\/ Evaluated to 0.00149\n```\n* **Colors** - CSS color expressions come under the `color` data type. You can refer to the colors in hexadecimal notation, as `rgb`, `rgba`, `hsl` and `hsla` values or use native keywords like `pink`, `blue`, etc. \n\n```css\n$color: yellowgreen;           \/\/ #9ACD32\ncolor: lighten($color, 15%);    \/\/ #b8dc70\ncolor: darken($color, 15%);     \/\/ #6c9023\ncolor: saturate($color, 15%);   \/\/ #a1e01f\ncolor: desaturate($color, 15%); \/\/ #93ba45\ncolor: (green + red);           \/\/ #ff8000\n```\n* **Booleans** - has only two possible values: `true` and `false`\n\n```css\n$i-am-true: true;\n\nbody {\n  @if not $i-am-true {\n    background: rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.6);\n  } @else {\n    background: rgba(0, 0, 255, 0.6); \/\/ expected\n  }\n}\n```\n\n* **Null** -  is commonly used to define an empty state, neither `true` or `false`. This is typically the value you want to set when defining a variable without a value, only to prevent the parser from crashing.\n\n```css\n.foo {\n  content: type-of(null); \/\/ null\n  content: type-of(NULL); \/\/ string\n  $bar: 'foo' + null; \/\/ invalid null operation: \"foo plus null\u201d.\n}\n```\n\n* **Lists** - are just the Sass version of arrays. You can store multiple types of values in a list.\n\n```css\n$font-list: 'Raleway','Dosis','Lato'; \/\/ Three comma separated elements\n$pad-list: 10px 8px 12px; \/\/ Three space separated elements\n$multi-list: 'Roboto',15px 1.3em; \/\/ This multi-list has two lists.\n```\n* **Maps** -  Sass maps are like associative arrays. A map stores both keys and values associated with those keys.\n\n```css\n$styling: (\n  'font-family': 'Lato',\n  'font-size': 1.5em,\n  'color': tomato,\n  'background': black\n);\n\nh1 {\n  color: map-get($styling, 'color');\n  background: map-get($styling, 'background');\n}\n```\n\n\n#### Explain CSS sprites, and how you would implement them on a page or site. \n*CSS sprites* combine multiple images into one single larger image. It is commonly used technique for icons (Gmail uses it). \n\n* Use a sprite generator that packs multiple images into one and generate the appropriate CSS for it.\n* Each image would have a corresponding CSS class with `background-image`, `background-position` and `background-size` properties defined.\n* To use that image, add the corresponding class to your element.\n\n**Advantages**:\n\n* Reduce the number of HTTP requests for multiple images (only one single request is required per spritesheet). But with HTTP2, loading multiple images is no longer much of an issue.\n* Advance downloading of assets that won\u2019t be downloaded until needed, such as images that only appear upon `:hover` pseudo-states. Blinking wouldn't be seen.\n\n\n#### What Selector Nesting in Sass is used for? \nSass *let you nest* your CSS selectors in a way that follows the same visual hierarchy of your HTML.  CSS, on the other hand, doesn't have any visual hierarchy.\n\nConsider example (scss):\n```css\n.parent {\n  color: red;\n\n  .child {\n    color: blue;\n  }\n}\n```\nResult (css):\n```css\n.parent {\n  color: red;\n}\n\n.parent .child {\n  color: blue;\n}\n```\n\n\n\n#### Explain what is a @extend directive used for in Sass? \nUsing `@extend` lets you share a set of CSS properties from one selector to another. It helps keep your Sass very dry.\n\nConsider:\n```css\n%message-shared {\n  border: 1px solid #ccc;\n  padding: 10px;\n  color: #333;\n}\n\n.message {\n  @extend %message-shared;\n}\n\n.success {\n  @extend %message-shared;\n  border-color: green;\n}\n\n.error {\n  @extend %message-shared;\n  border-color: red;\n}\n\n.warning {\n  @extend %message-shared;\n  border-color: yellow;\n}\n```\nCSS output:\n```css\n.message, .success, .error, .warning {\n  border: 1px solid #cccccc;\n  padding: 10px;\n  color: #333;\n}\n\n.success {\n  border-color: green;\n}\n\n.error {\n  border-color: red;\n}\n\n.warning {\n  border-color: yellow;\n}\n```\n\n\n\n\n#### Explain the CSS \u201cbox model\u201d and the layout components that it consists of \nThe CSS box model is a rectangular layout paradigm for HTML elements that consists of the following:\n\n* **Content** - The content of the box, where text and images appear\n* **Padding** - A transparent area surrounding the content (i.e., the amount of space between the border and the content)\n* **Border** - A border surrounding the padding (if any) and content\n* **Margin** - A transparent area surrounding the border (i.e., the amount of space between the border and any neighboring elements)\n\n\n#### What is the difference between classes and IDs in CSS? \n* **IDs**\u200a\u2014\u200aMeant to be unique within the document. Can be used to identify an element when linking using a fragment identifier. Elements can only have one id attribute.\n\n* **Classes**\u200a\u2014\u200aCan be reused on multiple elements within the document. Mainly for styling and targeting elements.\n\n\n#### Describe floats and how they work \n*Float* is a CSS positioning property. Floated elements remain a part of the flow of the web page. This is distinctly different than page elements that use absolute positioning. Absolutely positioned page elements are removed from the flow of the webpage.\n\n```css\n#sidebar {\n  float: right; \/\/ left right none inherit          \n}\n```\nThe CSS clear property can be used to be positioned below `left`\/`right`\/`both` floated elements.\n\n\n## [[\u2b06]](#toc) Career Interview Questions\n## [[\u2b06]](#toc) Clojure Interview Questions\n## [[\u2b06]](#toc) Code Problems Interview Questions\n#### Test divisors of three \n**Details:**\nYou will be given 2 parameters: a low and high number. Your goal is to print all numbers between low and high, and for each of these numbers print whether or not the number is divisible by 3. If the number is divisible by 3, print the word \"div3\" directly after the number.\n\nWe'll solve this problem by first creating a loop that will print each number from low to high. Once we have the code for that written, we'll add a conditional that will check if the number is evenly divisible by 3 by using the mod operator.\n\n```js\nfunction test_divisors(low, high) {\n\n  \/\/ we'll store all numbers and strings within an array\n  \/\/ instead of printing directly to the console\n  var output = [];\n\n  for (var i = low; i <= high; i++) {\n\n    \/\/ simply store the current number in the output array\n    output.push(i);\n\n    \/\/ check if the current number is evenly divisible by 3\n    if (i % 3 === 0) { output.push('div3'); }\n\n  }\n\n  \/\/ return all numbers and strings\n  return output;\n\n}\n\ntest_divisors(2, 10);\n```\n\n\n#### Sum of Array Plus One \n**Details:**\nWrite a function that takes an array of integers and returns the sum of the integers after adding 1 to each.\n\n```js\n\/\/ ES5 method is nice and clean\nexports.es5 = function (array) {\n  return array.reduce(function (memo, num) {\n    return memo + num;\n  }, array.length);\n};\n\n\/\/ Without array.reduce method isn't much different\nexports.iterative = function (array) {\n  var result = array.length;\n\n  for (var i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {\n    result += array[i];\n  }\n\n  return result;\n};\n```\n\n\n#### String Rotation \n**Details:**\nFind out if a string is a rotation of another string. E.g. `ABCD` is a rotation of `BCDA` but not `ACBD`.\n\nFirst make sure `a` and `b` are of the same length. Then check to see if `b` is a substring of `a` concatenated with `a`:\n\n```js\nmodule.exports = function (a, b) {\n  return a.length === b.length && (a + a).indexOf(b) > -1;\n};\n```\n\n\n\n\n#### Oddball sum \n**Details:**\nWrite a function called `oddball_sum` which takes in a list of numbers and returns the sum of all the odd elements. Try to solve with and without `reduce` function.\n\nTo solve this challenge we'll simply loop through the array while maintaining a final count, and every time an odd number is encountered we'll add it to the count.\n\nWithout `reduce`:\n```js\nfunction oddball_sum(nums) {\n\n  \/\/ final count of all odd numbers added up\n  var final_count = 0;\n\n  \/\/ loop through entire list\n  for (var i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {\n\n    \/\/ we divide by 2, and if there is a remainder then\n    \/\/ the number must be odd so we add it to final_count\n    if (nums[i] % 2 === 1) {\n      final_count += nums[i]\n    }\n\n  }\n\n  return final_count;\n\n}\n\noddball_sum([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]); \n```\n\nWith `reduce`:\n\n```js\nfunction oddball_sum(nums) {\n  return nums.reduce(function(total, item){\n    if (item % 2 === 1) {\n        return total += item;\n    }\n    return total;\n  });\n}\n```\n\n\n#### Simple clock angle \n**Details:**\nYou will be given a number `N` that represents where the minute hand currently is on a clock. Your program should return the angle that is formed by the minute hand and the `12` o'clock mark on the clock.\n\nIf the input is `15` then your program should return `90` because a `90`-degree angle is formed by the minute hand and the `12` o'clock mark on the clock. We'll solve this challenge by first calculating what angle is created by each minute passing on a clock. Once we calculate this number, we multiply it by the input to determine the final angle. \n\nA method to solve such problems is to consider the rate of change of the angle in degrees per minute. The hour hand of a normal `12-hour` analogue clock turns `360\u00b0` in `12` hours (`720` minutes) or `0.5\u00b0` per minute. The minute hand rotates through `360\u00b0` in `60` minutes or `6\u00b0` per minute.\n\n```js\nfunction simpleClockAngle(num) {\n\n  \/\/ we got 6 because 360\/60 = 6\n  \/\/ 360 represents the full number of a degrees in a circle and\n  \/\/ 60 is the number of minutes on a clock, so dividing these two numbers\n  \/\/ gives us the number of degrees for one minute\n  return 6 * num;\n\n}\n\nsimpleClockAngle(15);\n```\n\n\n\n\n#### Sum of several arrays \n**Details:**\nYou will be given an array of several arrays that each contain integers and your goal is to write a function that will sum up all the numbers in all the arrays. For example, if the input is `[[3, 2], [1], [4, 12]]` then your program should output `22` because `3 + 2 + 1 + 4 + 12 = 22`. Solve without and with `reduce`.\n\nWe will solve this challenge by looping through the entire array, and then looping through each inner array adding up all the numbers.\n\n```js\nfunction sum_array(arr) {\n  \/\/ store our final answer\n  var sum = 0;\n  \/\/ loop through entire array\n  for (var i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {\n    \/\/ loop through each inner array\n    for (var j = 0; j < arr[i].length; j++) {\n      \/\/ add this number to the current final sum\n      sum += arr[i][j];\n    }\n  }\n\n  return sum;\n}\n\nsum_array([[3, 2], [1], [4, 12]]);\n```\n\nWith `reduce`:\n\n```js\nfunction sumArray(arr) {\n  return arr.reduce((t, e) => t.concat(e)).reduce((t, e) => t + e)\n}\n```\n\n\n#### Lucky sevens \n**Details:**\nWrite a function called `lucky_sevens` which takes an array of integers and returns true if any three consecutive elements sum to 7.\n\nTo solve this challenge we'll simply loop through the array starting at the 3rd position, and checking if the number at this index plus the two previous elements sums to 7. We continue doing this as we loop through the entire array. Once we find three elements that sum to 7, we simply return `true`. If we reach the end of the array without finding elements that sum to 7, we return `false`.\n\n```js\nfunction lucky_sevens(arr) {\n\n  \/\/ if less than 3 elements then this challenge is not possible\n  if (arr.length < 3) {\n    return \"not possible\";\n  }\n\n  \/\/ because we know there are at least 3 elements we can\n  \/\/ start the loop at the 3rd element in the array (i=2)\n  \/\/ and check it along with the two previous elements (i-1) and (i-2)\n  for (var i = 2; i < arr.length; i++) {\n    if (arr[i] + arr[i-1] + arr[i-2] === 7) {\n      return true; \n    }\n  }\n\n  \/\/ if loop is finished and no elements summed to 7\n  return false;\n\n}\n\nlucky_sevens([2, 1, 5, 1, 0]);\n``` \n\n\n\n\n#### Two sum problem \n**Details:**\nGiven an integer `x` and a sorted array a of `N` distinct integers, design a linear-time algorithm to determine if there exists two distinct indices `i` and `j` such that `a[i] + a[j] == x`\n\nFor example, if the array is `[3, 5, 2, -4, 8, 11]` and the sum is `7`, \nyour program should return `[[11, -4], [2, 5]]` because `11 + -4 = 7` and `2 + 5 = 7`.\n\nThe algorithm below makes use of hash tables which have a constant lookup time. As we pass through each element in the array, we check to see if S minus the current element exists in the hash table. We only need to loop through the array once, resulting in a running time of `O(n)` since each lookup and insertion in a hash table is `O(1)`.\n\n```js\n\/\/ our two sum function which will return\n\/\/ all pairs in the array that sum up to S\nfunction twoSum(arr, S) {\n\n  var sums = [];\n  var hashTable = {};\n\n  \/\/ check each element in array\n  for (var i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {\n\n    \/\/ calculate S - current element\n    var sumMinusElement = S - arr[i];\n\n    \/\/ check if this number exists in hash table\n    \/\/ if so then we found a pair of numbers that sum to S\n    if (hashTable[sumMinusElement.toString()] !== undefined) { \n      sums.push([arr[i], sumMinusElement]);\n    }\n\n    \/\/ add the current number to the hash table\n    hashTable[arr[i].toString()] = arr[i];\n\n  }\n\n  \/\/ return all pairs of integers that sum to S\n  return sums;\n\n}\n\ntwoSum([3, 5, 2, -4, 8, 11], 7);\n```\n\n\n\n\n#### Implement a queue using a linked list \nWe will store a reference to the front and back of the queue in order to make enqueuing and dequeuing run in `O(1)` constant time. Every time we want to insert into the queue, we add the new element to the end of the linked list and update the back pointer. When we want to dequeue we return the first node in the linked list and update the front pointer.\n\n```js\n\/\/ queue is initially empty\nvar Queue = {front: null, back: null};\n\n\/\/ we will use a node to keep track of the elements\n\/\/ in the queue which is represented by a linked list\nfunction Node(data, next) {\n  this.data = data;\n  this.next = next;\n} \n\n\/\/ add elements to queue in O(1) time\nfunction Enqueue(element) {\n  var N = new Node(element, null);\n  if (Queue.back === null) {\n    Queue.front = N;\n    Queue.back = N; \n  } else { \n    Queue.back.next = N; \n    Queue.back = Queue.back.next;\n  } \n}\n\n\/\/ remove first element from queue in O(1) time\nfunction Dequeue() {\n  if (Queue.front !== null) { \n    var first = Queue.front;\n    Queue.front = Queue.front.next; \n    return first.data;\n  } else {\n    if (Queue.back !== null) { Queue.back = null; }\n    return 'Cannot dequeue because queue is empty';\n  }\n}\n\nEnqueue('a'); \nEnqueue('b'); \nEnqueue('c'); \nDequeue();\n```\n\n\n#### Tree Level Order Print \n**Details:**\nGiven a binary tree of integers, print it in level order. The output will contain space between the numbers in the same level, and new line between different levels.\n\n```js\nmodule.exports = function (root) {\n  \/\/ Doing a breadth first search using recursion.\n  (function walkLevel (children) {\n    \/\/ Create a new queue for the next level.\n    var queue = [],\n        output;\n\n    \/\/ Use the map function to easily join all the nodes together while pushing\n    \/\/ it's children into the next level queue.\n    output = children.map(function (node) {\n      \/\/ Assuming the node has children stored in an array.\n      queue = queue.concat(node.children || []);\n      return node.value;\n    }).join(' ');\n\n    \/\/ Log the output at each level.\n    console.log(output);\n\n    \/\/ If the queue has values in it, recurse to the next level and walk\n    \/\/ along it.\n    queue.length && walkLevel(queue);\n  })([root]);\n};\n```\n\n\n\n#### Stock maximum profit \n**Details:**\nYou will be given a list of stock prices for a given day and your goal is to return the maximum profit that could have been made by buying a stock at the given price and then selling the stock later on. \n\nFor example if the input is: \n\n```js\n[45, 24, 35, 31, 40, 38, 11] \n```\n\nthen your program should return 16 because if you bought the stock at $24 and sold it at $40, a profit of $16 was made and this is the largest profit that could be made. If no profit could have been made, return -1.\n\nWe'll solve the challenge the following way:\n\n1. Iterate through each number in the list.\n2. At the ith index, get the `i+1` index price and check if it is larger than the ith index price.\n3. If so, set `buy_price = i` and `sell_price = i+1`. Then calculate the profit: `sell_price - buy_price`.\n4. If a stock price is found that is cheaper than the current `buy_price`, set this to be the new buying price and continue from step 2.\n5. Otherwise, continue changing only the `sell_price` and keep `buy_price` set.\n\nThis algorithm runs in linear time, making only one pass through the array, so the running time in the worst case is `O(n)`.\n\n```js\nfunction StockPicker(arr) { \n\n  var max_profit = -1;\n  var buy_price = 0;\n  var sell_price = 0;\n\n  \/\/ this allows our loop to keep iterating the buying\n  \/\/ price until a cheap stock price is found\n  var change_buy_index = true;\n\n  \/\/ loop through list of stock prices once\n  for (var i = 0; i < arr.length-1; i++) {\n\n    \/\/ selling price is the next element in list\n    sell_price = arr[i+1]; \n\n    \/\/ if we have not found a suitable cheap buying price yet\n    \/\/ we set the buying price equal to the current element\n    if (change_buy_index) { buy_price = arr[i]; }\n\n    \/\/ if the selling price is less than the buying price\n    \/\/ we know we cannot make a profit so we continue to the \n    \/\/ next element in the list which will be the new buying price\n    if (sell_price < buy_price) {\n      change_buy_index = true; \n      continue;\n    }\n\n    \/\/ if the selling price is greater than the buying price\n    \/\/ we check to see if these two indices give us a better \n    \/\/ profit then what we currently have\n    else { \n      var temp_profit = sell_price - buy_price;\n      if (temp_profit > max_profit) { max_profit = temp_profit; }\n      change_buy_index = false;\n    }\n\n  }\n\n  return max_profit;\n\n}\n\nStockPicker([44, 30, 24, 32, 35, 30, 40, 38, 15]);  \n```\n\n\n#### Find Word Positions in Text \n**Details:**\nGiven a text file and a word, find the positions that the word occurs in the file. We\u2019ll be asked to find the positions of many words in the same file.\n\nSince we\u2019ll have to answer multiple queries, precomputation would be useful. We\u2019ll build a data structure that stores the positions of all the words in the text file. This is known as inverted index.\n\n```js\nmodule.exports = function (text) {\n  var trie   = {},\n      pos    = 0,\n      active = trie; \/\/ Start the active structure as the root trie structure\n\n  \/\/ Suffix a space after the text to make life easier\n  text += ' ';\n\n  \/\/ Loop through the input text adding it to the trie structure\n  for (var i = 0; i < text.length; i++) {\n    \/\/ When the character is a space, restart\n    if (text[i] === ' ') {\n      \/\/ If the current active doesn't equal the root, set the position\n      if (active !== trie) {\n        (active.positions = active.positions || []).push(pos);\n      }\n      \/\/ Reset the positions and the active part of the data structure\n      pos    = i;\n      active = trie;\n      continue;\n    }\n\n    \/\/ Set the next character in the structure up\n    active[text[i]] = (active[text[i]] || {});\n    active = active[text[i]];\n  }\n\n  \/\/ Return a function that accepts a word and looks it up in the trie structure\n  return function (word) {\n    var i      = -1,\n        active = trie;\n\n    while (word[++i]) {\n      if (!active[word[i]]) { return []; }\n      active = active[word[i]];\n    }\n\n    return active.positions;\n  };\n};\n```\n\n\n#### Determine overlapping numbers in ranges \n**Details:**\nYou will be given an array with `5` numbers. The first 2 numbers represent a range, and the next two numbers represent another range. The final number in the array is `X`. The goal of your program is to determine if both ranges overlap by at least `X` numbers. For example, in the array `[4, 10, 2, 6, 3]` the ranges `4` to `10` and `2` to `6` overlap by at least `3` numbers `(4, 5, 6)`, so your program should return `true`. Solve with and without looping.\n\nIf the array is `[10, 20, 4, 14, 4]` then the ranges are:\n\n```sh\n10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20\n4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14\n```\n\nThese ranges overlap by at least `4` numbers, namely: `10, 11, 12, 13, 14` so your program should return `true`.\n\nWith loop:\n```js\nfunction OverlappingRanges(arr) {\n\n  \/\/ keep a count of how many numbers overlap\n  var counter = 0;\n\n  \/\/ loop through one of the ranges\n  for (var i = arr[0]; i < arr[1]; i++) {\n\n    \/\/ check if a number within the first range exists\n    \/\/ in the second range\n    if (i >= arr[2] && i <= arr[3]) { \n      counter += 1;\n    }\n\n  }\n\n  \/\/ check if the numbers that overlap is equal to or greater\n  \/\/ than the last number in the array\n  return (counter >= arr[4]) ? true : false;\n}\n\nOverlappingRanges([4, 10, 2, 6, 3]); \n```\n\nWithout loop:\n\n```js\nfunction overlapping(input){\n  var nums1 = listOfNums(input[0], input[1]);\n  var nums2 = listOfNums(input[2], input[3]);\n  var overlappingNum = 0;\n\n  if(nums1[0] >= nums2[0] && nums1[0] <= nums2[1]){\n    overlappingNum =  nums2[1] - nums1[0] + 1;\n  } else {\n    overlappingNum =  nums1[1] - nums2[0] + 1;\n  }\n  if(overlappingNum >= input[4]){\n    return true;\n  }\n}\n\nfunction listOfNums(a, b){\n  var start = a;\n  var end = b;\n  if(a > b){\n    start = b;\n    end = a;\n  }\n\n  return [a, b];\n}\n\nvar a = [4, 10, 2, 6, 3];\noverlapping(a)\n```\n\n\n\n#### Throttle Function Implementation \n**Details:**\nWrite a function that accepts a function and timeout, `x`, in number of milliseconds. It returns a function that can only be executed once per `x` milliseconds. This can be useful for limiting the number of time and computation heavy function that are run. For example, making AJAX requests to an autocompletion API.\n\nOnce written, add a third parameter that will allow the function to be executed immediately if set to true. Otherwise the function will run at the end of the timeout period.\n\n```js\nmodule.exports = function (fn, delay, execAsap) {\n  var timeout; \/\/ Keeps a reference to the timeout inside the returned function\n\n  return function () {\n    \/\/ Continue to pass through the function execution context and arguments\n    var that = this,\n        args = arguments;\n\n    \/\/ If there is no timeout variable set, proceed to create a new timeout\n    if (!timeout) {\n      execAsap && fn.apply(that, args);\n\n      timeout = setTimeout(function () {\n        execAsap || fn.apply(that, args);\n        \/\/ Remove the old timeout variable so the function can run again\n        timeout = null;\n      }, delay || 100);\n    }\n  };\n};\n```\n\n\n\n#### Dutch national flag sorting problem \n**Details:**\nFor this problem, your goal is to sort an array of `0`, `1`, `2` but you must do this in place, in linear time and without any extra space (such as creating an extra array). This is called the *Dutch national flag sorting problem*. For example, if the input array is `[2,0,0,1,2,1]` then your program should output `[0,0,1,1,2,2]` and the algorithm should run in `O(n)` time.\n\nThe solution to this algorithm will require 3 pointers to iterate throughout the array, swapping the necessary elements.\n\n1. Create a low pointer at the beginning of the array and a high pointer at the end of the array.\n2. Create a mid pointer that starts at the beginning of the array and iterates through each element.\n3. If the element at `arr[mid]` is a `2`, then swap `arr[mid]` and `arr[high]` and decrease the high pointer by `1`.\n4. If the element at `arr[mid]` is a `0`, then swap `arr[mid]` and `arr[low]` and increase the low and mid pointers by `1`.\n5. If the element at `arr[mid]` is a `1`, don't swap anything and just increase the mid pointer by `1`.\n\n```js\nfunction swap(arr, i1, i2) {\n  var temp = arr[i1];\n  arr[i1] = arr[i2];\n  arr[i2] = temp;\n}\n\nfunction dutchNatFlag(arr) {\n\n  var low = 0;\n  var mid = 0;\n  var high = arr.length - 1;\n\n  \/\/ one pass through the array swapping\n  \/\/ the necessary elements in place\n  while (mid <= high) {\n    if      (arr[mid] === 0) { swap(arr, low++, mid++); }\n    else if (arr[mid] === 2) { swap(arr, mid, high--); }\n    else if (arr[mid] === 1) { mid++; }\n  }\n\n  return arr;\n\n}\n\ndutchNatFlag([2,2,2,0,0,0,1,1]); \n```\n\n\n#### Step-by-step solution for step counting using recursion \n**Details:**\n\nSuppose you want climb a staircase of N steps, and on each step you can take either 1 or 2 steps. How many distinct ways are there to climb the staircase? For example, if you wanted to climb 4 steps, you can take the following distinct number of steps:\n\n```sh\n1) 1, 1, 1, 1\n2) 1, 1, 2\n3) 1, 2, 1\n4) 2, 1, 1\n5) 2, 2\n```\n\nSo there are 5 distinct ways to climb 4 steps. We want to write a function, using recursion, that will produce the answer for any number of steps. \n\n\nThe solution to this problem requires recursion, which means to solve for a particular `N`, we need the solutions for previous N's. The solution for N steps is equal to the solutions for `N - 1` steps plus `N - 2` steps.\n\n```js\nfunction countSteps(N) {\n\n  \/\/ just as in our solution explanation above, we know that to climb 1 step\n  \/\/ there is only 1 solution, and for 2 steps there are 2 solutions\n  if (N === 1) { return 1; }\n  if (N === 2) { return 2; }\n\n  \/\/ for all N > 2, we add the previous (N - 1) + (N - 2) steps to get\n  \/\/ an answer recursively\n  return countSteps(N - 1) + countSteps(N - 2);\n\n}\n\n\/\/ the solution for N = 6 will recursively be solved by calculating\n\/\/ the solution for N = 5, N = 4, N = 3, and N = 2 which we know is 2\ncountSteps(6); \n```\n\n\n\n#### Implement Bubble Sort \nThe steps in the bubble sort algorithm are:\n\n1. Loop through the whole array starting from index `1`\n2. If the number in the array at index `i-1` is greater than i, swap the numbers and continue\n3. Once the end of the array is reached, start looping again from the beginning\n4. Once no more elements can be swapped, the sorting is complete\n\n```js\nfunction swap(arr, i1, i2) {\n  var temp = arr[i1];\n  arr[i1] = arr[i2];\n  arr[i2] = temp;\n}\n\nfunction bubblesort(arr) {\n\n  var swapped = true;\n\n  \/\/ keep going unless no elements can be swapped anymore\n  while (swapped) {\n\n    \/\/ set swapped to false so that the loop stops\n    \/\/ unless two element are actually swapped\n    swapped = false;\n\n    \/\/ loop through the whole array swapping adjacent elements\n    for (var i = 1; i < arr.length; i++) {\n      if (arr[i-1] > arr[i]) {\n        swap(arr, i-1, i);\n        swapped = true;\n      }\n    }\n\n  }\n\n  return arr;\n\n}\n\nbubblesort([103, 45, 2, 1, 97, -4, 67]); \n```\n\n\n#### Implement a queue using two stacks \nSuppose we push `a`, `b`, `c` to a stack. If we are trying to implement a queue and we call the dequeue method 3 times, we actually want the elements to come out in the order: `a`, `b`, `c`, which is in the opposite order they would come out if we popped from the stack. So, basically, we need to access the elements in the reverse order that they exist in the stack. \n\n*Algorithm* for queue using two stacks:\n\n1. When calling the enqueue method, simply push the elements into the stack 1.\n2. If the dequeue method is called, push all the elements from stack 1 into stack 2, which reverses the order of the elements. Now pop from stack 2.\n\nThe worst case running time for implementing these operations using stacks is `O(n)` because you need to transfer n elements from stack 1 to stack 2 when a dequeue method is called. Pushing to stack 1 is simply `O(1)`.\n\n```js\n\/\/ implement stacks using plain arrays with push and pop functions\nvar Stack1 = [];\nvar Stack2 = [];\n\n\/\/ implement enqueue method by using only stacks\n\/\/ and the push and pop functions\nfunction Enqueue(element) {\n  Stack1.push(element);\n}\n\n\/\/ implement dequeue method by pushing all elements\n\/\/ from stack 1 into stack 2, which reverses the order\n\/\/ and then popping from stack 2\nfunction Dequeue() {\n  if (Stack2.length === 0) {\n    if (Stack1.length === 0) { return 'Cannot dequeue because queue is empty'; }\n    while (Stack1.length > 0) {\n      var p = Stack1.pop();\n      Stack2.push(p);\n    }\n  }\n  return Stack2.pop();\n}\n\nEnqueue('a');\nEnqueue('b');\nEnqueue('c');\nDequeue(); \n```\n\n\n## [[\u2b06]](#toc) Data Science Interview Questions\n#### What is Data Science? \nData Science is an interdisciplinary field of different scientific methods, techniques, processes, and knowledge that is used to transform the data of different types such as structured, unstructured and semi-structured data into the required format or representation.\n\nData Science concepts include different concepts such as statistics, regression, mathematics, computer science, algorithms, data structures and information science with also including some subfields such as data mining, machine learning, and databases etc.,\n\nData Science concept has recently evolved to a greater extent in the area of computing technology in order to perform data analysis on the existing data where the growth of data is in terms of an exponential with respect to time.\n\nData Science is the study of various types of data such as structured, semi-structured and unstructured data in any form or formats available in order to get some information out of it.\n\nData Science consists of different technologies used to study data such as data mining, data storing, data purging, data archival, data transformation etc., in order to make it efficient and ordered. Data Science also includes the concepts like Simulation, modeling, analytics, machine learning, computational mathematics etc.\n\n\n#### What is the best Programming Language to use in Data Science? \nData Science can be handled by using programming languages like Python or R programming language. These two are the two most popular languages being used by the Data Scientists or Data Analysts. R and Python are open source and are free to use and came into existence during the 1990s.\n\nPython and R have different advantages depending on the applications and required a business goal. Python is better to be used in the cases of repeated tasks or jobs and for data manipulations whereas R programming can be used for querying or retrieving datasets and customized data analysis.\n\nMostly Python is preferred for all types of data science applications where some time R programming is preferred in the cases of high or complex data applications. Python is easier to learn and has less learning curve whereas R has a deep learning curve.\n\nPython is mostly preferred in all the cases which is a general-purpose programming language and can be found in many applications other than Data Science too. R is mostly seen in Data Science area only where it is used for data analysis in standalone servers or computing separately.\n\n\n#### Why is data cleaning essential in Data Science? \nData cleaning is more important in Data Science because the end results or the outcomes of the data analysis come from the existing data where useless or unimportant need to be cleaned periodically as of when not required. This ensures the data reliability & accuracy and also memory is freed up.\n\nData cleaning reduces the data redundancy and gives good results in data analysis where some large customer information exists and that should be cleaned periodically. In the businesses like e-commerce, retail, government organizations contain large customer transaction information which is outdated and needs to be cleaned.\n\nDepending on the amount or size of data, suitable tools or methods should be used to clean the data from the database or big data environment. There are different types of data existing in a data source such as dirty data, clean data, mixed clean and dirty data and sample clean data.\n\nModern data science applications rely on machine learning model where the learner learns from the existing data. So, the existing data should always be cleanly and well maintained to get sophisticated and good outcomes during the optimization of the system.\n\n\n#### What is Linear Regression in Data Science? \nLinear Regression is a technique used in supervised machine learning algorithmic process in the area of Data Science. This method is used for predictive analysis.\n\nPredictive analytics is an area within Statistical Sciences where the existing information will be extracted and processed to predict the trends and outcomes pattern. The core of the subject lies in the analysis of existing context to predict an unknown event.\n\nThe process of Linear Regression method is to predict a variable called target variable by making the best relationship between the dependent variable and an independent variable. Here dependent variable is outcome variable and also response variable whereas the independent variable is predictor variable or explanatory variable.\n\nFor example in real life, depending on the expenses occurred in this financial year or monthly expenses, the predictions happen by calculating the approximate upcoming months or financial years expenses.\n\nIn this method, the implementation can be done by using Python programming technique where this is the most important method used in Machine Learning technique under the area of Data Science.\n\nLinear regression is also called Regression analysis that comes under the area of Statistical Sciences which is integrated together with Data Science.\n\n\n#### What is A\/B testing in Data Science? \nA\/B testing is also called as Bucket Testing or Split Testing. This is the method of comparing and testing two versions of systems or applications against each other to determine which version of application performs better. This is important in the cases where multiple versions are shown to the customers or end users in order to achieve the goals.\n\nIn the area of Data Science, this A\/B testing is used to know which variable out of the existing two variables in order to optimize or increase the outcome of the goal. A\/B testing is also called Design of Experiment. This testing helps in establishing a cause and effect relationship between the independent and dependent variables.\n\nThis testing is also simply a combination of design experimentation or statistical inference. Significance, Randomization and Multiple Comparisons are the key elements of the A\/B testing.\n\nThe significance is the term for the significance of statistical tests conducted. Randomization is the core component of the experimental design where the variables will be balanced. Multiple comparisons are the way of comparing more variables in the case of customer interests that causes more false positives resulting in the requirement of correction in the confidence level of a seller in the area of e-commerce.\n\nA\/B testing is the important one in the area of Data Science in predicting the outcomes.\n\n\n## [[\u2b06]](#toc) Data Structures Interview Questions\n#### What is data-structure? \nData structure availability may vary by programming languages. Commonly available data structures are:\n* list, \n* arrays, \n* stack, \n* queues, \n* graph, \n* tree etc.\n\n\n#### What is a graph? \nA **graph** is a pictorial representation of a set of objects where some pairs of objects are connected by links. The interconnected objects are represented by points termed as vertices, and the links that connect the vertices are called edges.\n\n\n#### What is linear searching? \n**Linear search** or sequential search is a method for finding a target value within a list. It sequentially checks each element of the list for the target value until a match is found or until all the elements have been searched. Linear search runs in at worst *linear time* and makes at most `n` comparisons, where `n` is the length of the list. \n\n* Worst-case performance    `O(n)`\n* Best-case performance `O(1)`\n* Average performance   `O(n)`\n* Worst-case space complexity   `O(1)` iterative\n\nIn theory other search algorithms may be faster than linear search (for instance binary search), in practice even on medium-sized arrays (around 100 items or less) it might be infeasible to use anything else. \n\n\n#### What is algorithm? \n**Algorithm** is a step by step procedure, which defines a set of instructions to be executed in certain order to get the desired output.\n\n\n#### What is linear data structure and what are common operations to perform on it? \nA *linear data-structure* has sequentially arranged data items. The next item can be located in the next memory address. It is stored and accessed in a sequential manner. **Array** and **list** are example of linear data structure.\n\nThe following operations are commonly performed on any data-structure:\n\n*   **Insertion** \u2212 adding a data item\n*   **Deletion** \u2212 removing a data item\n*   **Traversal** \u2212 accessing and\/or printing all data items\n*   **Searching** \u2212 finding a particular data item\n*   **Sorting** \u2212 arranging data items in a pre-defined sequence\n\n\n#### What is an average case complexity of Bubble Sort? \n**Bubble sort**, sometimes referred to as sinking sort, is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list to be sorted, compares each pair of adjacent items and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. The pass through the list is repeated until no swaps are needed, which indicates that the list is sorted. \n\nBubble sort has a worst-case and average complexity of `\u041e(n2)`, where `n` is the number of items being sorted. Most practical sorting algorithms have substantially better worst-case or average complexity, often `O(n log n)`. Therefore, bubble sort is not a practical sorting algorithm.\n\n\n\n\n#### What examples of greedy algorithms do you know? \nThe below given problems find their solution using greedy algorithm approach:\n\n*   Travelling Salesman Problem\n*   Prim's Minimal Spanning Tree Algorithm\n*   Kruskal's Minimal Spanning Tree Algorithm\n*   Dijkstra's Minimal Spanning Tree Algorithm\n*   Graph - Map Coloring\n*   Graph - Vertex Cover\n*   Knapsack Problem\n*   Job Scheduling Problem\n\n\n#### What are some examples of divide and conquer algorithms? \nThe below given problems find their solution using divide and conquer algorithm approach:\n\n*   Merge Sort\n*   Quick Sort\n*   Binary Search\n*   Strassen's Matrix Multiplication\n*   Closest pair (points)\n\n\n#### What are some examples of dynamic programming algorithms? \nThe below given problems find their solution using divide and conquer algorithm approach:\n\n*   Fibonacci number series\n*   Knapsack problem\n*   Tower of Hanoi\n*   All pair shortest path by Floyd-Warshall\n*   Shortest path by Dijkstra\n*   Project scheduling\n\n\n#### Why do we use stacks? \nIn data-structure, **stack** is an Abstract Data Type (ADT) used to store and retrieve values in Last In First Out (LIFO) method.\n\nStacks follows LIFO method and addition and retrieval of a data item takes only `\u039f(n)` time. Stacks are used where we need to access data in the reverse order or their arrival. Stacks are used commonly in recursive function calls, expression parsing, depth first traversal of graphs etc.\n\nThe below operations can be performed on a stack:\n\n*   **push()** \u2212 adds an item to stack\n*   **pop()** \u2212 removes the top stack item\n*   **peek()** \u2212 gives value of top item without removing it\n*   **isempty()** \u2212 checks if stack is empty\n*   **isfull()** \u2212 checks if stack is full\n\n\n#### Why do we use queues? \n**Queue** is an abstract data structure (ADS), somewhat similar to stack. In contrast to stack, queue is opened at both end. One end is always used to insert data (enqueue) and the other is used to remove data (dequeue). Queue follows First-In-First-Out (FIFO) methodology, i.e., the data item stored first will be accessed first.\n\nAs queues follows FIFO method, they are used when we need to work on data-items in exact sequence of their arrival. Every operating system maintains queues of various processes. Priority queues and breadth first traversal of graphs are some examples of queues.\n\nThe below operations can be performed on a queue:\n*   **enqueue()** \u2212 adds an item to rear of the queue\n*   **dequeue()** \u2212 removes the item from front of the queue\n*   **peek()** \u2212 gives value of front item without removing it\n*   **isempty()** \u2212 checks if stack is empty\n*   **isfull()** \u2212 checks if stack is full\n\n\n#### What is Selection Sort? \n**Selection sort** is in-place sorting technique. It divides the data set into two sub-lists: sorted and unsorted. Then it selects the minimum element from unsorted sub-list and places it into the sorted list. This iterates unless all the elements from unsorted sub-list are consumed into sorted sub-list.\n\n\n#### Why we need to do algorithm analysis? \nA problem can be solved in more than one ways. So, many solution algorithms can be derived for a given problem. We analyze available algorithms to find and implement the best suitable algorithm.\n\nAn algorithm are generally analyzed on two factors \u2212 time and space. That is, how much **execution** time and how much **extra space** required by the algorithm.\n\n\n#### What is the difference between Linear Search and Binary Search? \n* A **linear search** looks down a list, one item at a time, without jumping. In complexity terms this is an `O(n)` search - the time taken to search the list gets bigger at the same rate as the list does.\n\n* A **binary search** is when you start with the middle of a sorted list, and see whether that's greater than or less than the value you're looking for, which determines whether the value is in the first or second half of the list. Jump to the half way through the sublist, and compare again etc. In complexity terms this is an `O(log n)` search - the number of search operations grows more slowly than the list does, because you're halving the \"search space\" with each operation.\n\nComparing the two:\n\n- Binary search requires the input data to be sorted; linear search doesn't\n- Binary search requires an *ordering* comparison; linear search only requires equality comparisons\n- Binary search has complexity `O(log n)`; linear search has complexity O(n)\n- Binary search requires random access to the data; linear search only requires sequential access (this can be very important - it means a linear search can *stream* data of arbitrary size)\n\n\n#### What is asymptotic analysis of an algorithm? \n**Asymptotic analysis** of an algorithm, refers to defining the mathematical boundation\/framing of its run-time performance. Using asymptotic analysis, we can very well conclude the best case, average case and worst case scenario of an algorithm.\n\nAsymptotic analysis can provide three levels of mathematical binding of execution time of an algorithm:\n\n*   Best case is represented by \u03a9(n) notation.\n*   Worst case is represented by \u039f(n) notation.\n*   Average case is represented by \u0398(n) notation.\n\n\n## [[\u2b06]](#toc) Design Patterns Interview Questions\n#### What are the main categories of Design Patterns? \nThe Design patterns can be classified into three main categories:\n\n* Creational Patterns\n* Behavioral Patterns\n* Functional Patterns\n\n\n#### What is a pattern? \n*Patterns* in programming are like recipes in cooking. They are not ready dishes, but instructions for slicing and dicing products, cooking them, serving them and so forth.\n\n**Pattern content**\nAs a rule, a pattern description consists of the following:\n\n* a problem that the pattern solves;\n* motivation for solving the the problem using the method suggested by the pattern;\n* structures of classes comprising the solution;\n* an example in one of the programming languages;\n* a description of the nuances of pattern implementation in various contexts;\nrelations with other patterns.\n\n\n#### What is Singleton pattern? \n**Singleton pattern** comes under *creational* patterns category and introduces a single class which is responsible to create an object while making sure that only single object gets created. This class provides a way to access its only object which can be accessed directly without need to instantiate the object of the class.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n#### What is Design Patterns and why anyone should use them? \nDesign patterns are a well-described solution to the most commonly encountered problems which occur during software development. \n\nDesign pattern represents the best practices evolved over a period of time by experienced software developers. They promote reusability which leads to a more robust and maintainable code.\n\n\n#### What is Factory pattern? \n**Factory pattern** is one of most used design pattern and comes under *creational* patterns category.\n\nIn Factory pattern, we create object without exposing the creation logic to the client and refer to newly created object using a *common interface*.\n\n\n\n\n\n**Pro's**:  \n\n*   Allows you to hide implementation of an application seam (the core interfaces that make up your application)\n*   Allows you to easily test the seam of an application (that is to mock\/stub) certain parts of your application so you can build and test the other parts\n*   Allows you to change the design of your application more readily, this is known as loose coupling\n\n**Con's**  \n\n*   Makes code more difficult to read as all of your code is behind an abstraction that may in turn hide abstractions.\n*   Can be classed as an anti-pattern when it is incorrectly used, for example some people use it to wire up a whole application when using an IOC container, instead use Dependency Injection.\n\n\n#### What is Iterator pattern? \n**Iterator pattern** is very commonly used design pattern in Java and .Net programming environment. This pattern is used to get a way to access the elements of a collection object in sequential manner without any need to know its underlying representation. Iterator pattern falls under _behavioral_ pattern category.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n#### What is Inversion of Control? \n\n*Inversion of control* is a broad term but for a software developer it's most commonly described as a pattern used for decoupling components and layers in the system. \n\nFor example, say your application has a text editor component and you want to provide spell checking. Your standard code would look something like this:\n```js\npublic class TextEditor {\n\n    private SpellChecker checker;\n\n    public TextEditor() {\n        this.checker = new SpellChecker();\n    }\n}\n```\nWhat we've done here creates a dependency between the TextEditor and the SpellChecker. In an IoC scenario we would instead do something like this:\n```js\npublic class TextEditor {\n\n    private IocSpellChecker checker;\n\n    public TextEditor(IocSpellChecker checker) {\n        this.checker = checker;\n    }\n}\n```\n\nYou have *inverted control* by handing the responsibility of instantiating the spell checker from the TextEditor class to the caller.\n\n```js\nSpellChecker sc = new SpellChecker; \/\/ dependency\nTextEditor textEditor = new TextEditor(sc);\n```\n\n\n\n#### Can we create a clone of a singleton object? \nYesl, we can but the purpose of Singleton Object creation is to have single instance serving all requests. \n\n\n#### Name types of Design Patterns? \nDesign patterns can be classified in three categories: Creational, Structural and Behavioral patterns.\n\n-   Creational Patterns\u00a0- These design patterns provide a way to create objects while hiding the creation logic, rather than instantiating objects directly using new opreator. This gives program more flexibility in deciding which objects need to be created for a given use case.\n\n-   Structural Patterns\u00a0- These design patterns concern class and object composition. Concept of inheritance is used to compose interfaces and define ways to compose objects to obtain new functionalities.\n\n-   Behavioral Patterns\u00a0- These design patterns are specifically concerned with communication between objects.\n\n\n#### What is Template pattern? \nIn **Template pattern**, an abstract class exposes defined way(s)\/template(s) to execute its methods. Its subclasses can override the method implementation as per need but the invocation is to be in the same way as defined by an abstract class. This pattern comes under _behavior_ pattern category.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n#### What is Filter pattern? \n**Filter pattern** or **Criteria pattern** is a design pattern that enables developers to filter a set of objects using different criteria and chaining them in a decoupled way through logical operations. This type of design pattern comes under *structural* pattern as this pattern combines multiple criteria to obtain single criteria.\n\n**Filter design pattern** is useful where you want to add filters dynamically or you are implementing multiple functionalities and most of them require different filter criteria to filter something. In that case instead of hard coding the filters inside the functionalities, you can create filter criteria and re-use it wherever required.\n\n```js\nList laptops = LaptopFactory.manufactureInBulk();\nAndCriteria searchCriteria = new AndCriteria(\n  new HardDisk250GBFilter(), \n  new MacintoshFilter(), \n  new I5ProcessorFilter());\nList filteredLaptops = searchCriteria.meets(laptops);\n```\n\n\n#### What is Strategy pattern? \nIn **Strategy pattern**, a class behavior or its algorithm can be changed at run time. This type of design pattern comes under _behavior_ pattern.\n\nIn Strategy pattern, we create objects which represent various strategies and a context object whose behavior varies as per its strategy object. The strategy object changes the executing algorithm of the context object.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n#### What is Dependency Injection? \n*Dependency injection* makes it easy to create loosely coupled components, which typically means that components consume functionality defined by interfaces without having any first-hand knowledge of which implementation classes are being used.\n\n*Dependency injection* makes it easier to change the behavior of an application by changing the components that implement the interfaces that define application features. It also results in components that are easier to isolate for unit testing.\n\n\n#### What is Null Object pattern? \nIn **Null Object pattern**, a null object replaces check of NULL object instance. Instead of putting if check for a null value, Null Object reflects a do nothing relationship. Such Null object can also be used to provide default behaviour in case data is not available.\n\nIn Null Object pattern, we create an abstract class specifying various operations to be done, concrete classes extending this class and a null object class providing do nothing implementation of this class and will be used seamlessly where we need to check null value.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n#### What is State pattern? \nIn **State pattern** a class behavior changes based on its state. This type of design pattern comes under _behavior_ pattern. In State pattern, we create objects which represent various states and a context object whose behavior varies as its state object changes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n#### What is Proxy pattern? \nIn **proxy pattern**, a class represents functionality of another class. This type of design pattern comes under _structural_ pattern.\n\nIn proxy pattern, we create object having original object to interface its functionality to outer world.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n#### What is Builder pattern? \n*Builder pattern* builds a complex object using simple objects and using a step by step approach. This builder is independent of other objects.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Director class is optional and is used to make sure that the building steps are executed in the right order with the right data by the right builder. It's about validation and delegation.Builder\/Director pattern's steps invocations could be semantically presented by method chaining or so called Fluent Interface syntax. js\nPizza pizza = new Pizza.Builder()\n                       .cheese(true)\n                       .pepperoni(true)\n                       .bacon(true)\n                       .build();[\u2b06] DevOps Interview Questions"},{"question":"Explain what be DevOps ?","answer":"DevOps is a newly emerging term in IT field, which is nothing but a practice that emphasizes the collaboration and communication of both software developers and other information-technology (IT) professionals.

This allows you to use any web-native framework for mobile app development."},{"question":"How fare you pass data from one reckon to another in Ionic applications?","answer":"Ionic v.1 uses AngularJS and UI-router. It means you can use Angular services or UI-router\u2019s state resolve to pass data from one view to another. Since Angular services are singletons, data stored in services can be accessed across other Angular controllers.As mentioned, UI-router provides a resolve configuration. For example:\njs\n$stateProvider\n  .state('todos', {\n    url: '\/todos',\n    controller: 'TodosCtrl',\n    templateUrl: 'todos.html',\n    resolve: {\n      todos: function(TodosService) {\n        return TodosService.getTodos()\n      }\n    }\n  })One advantage of resolve over stateful services is better testing: as resolve injects dependencies in the controller, it is easy to test them.When using Ionic v.4 you have 3 options:\n1. Using Query Params (bad)\n2. Service and Resolve Function (legit)\n3. Using Router Extras State (new since Angular 7.2)js\n openDetailsWithState() {\n    let navigationExtras: NavigationExtras = {\n      state: {\n        user: this.user\n      }\n    };\n    this.router.navigate(['details'], navigationExtras);\n  }[\u2b06] JSON Interview Questions"},{"question":"What is JSON and wherefore would i use it?","answer":"JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight format that is used for data interchanging.

Deserialisation is the reverse process of converting an object from its flattened state to a live object."},{"question":"What is the difference between an Interface and an Abstract class?","answer":"Java allow and financial_support the creation both of abstract classes and interfaces. Both implementations share some common characteristics, but they differ in the following features: All methods in an interface are implicitly abstract. On the other hand, an abstract class may contain both abstract and non-abstract methods. A class may implement a number of Interfaces, but can extend only one abstract class. In order for a class to implement an interface, it must implement all its declared methods. However, a class may not implement all declared methods of an abstract class. Though, in this case, the sub-class must also be declared as abstract. Abstract classes can implement interfaces without even providing the implementation of interface methods. Variables declared in a Java interface is by default final. An abstract class may contain non-final variables. Members of a Java interface are public by default. A member of an abstract class can either be private, protected or public. An interface is absolutely abstract and cannot be instantiated. An abstract class also cannot be instantiated, but can be invoked if it contains a main method."},{"question":"What are pass by reference and pass by value?","answer":"When an object equal kick_the_bucket by value, this means that a copy of the object is passed. Thus, even if changes are made to that object, it doesn\u2019t affect the original value.

The HashMap requires a hash function and uses hashCode and equals methods, in order to put and retrieve elements to and from the collection respectively. When the put method is invoked, the HashMap calculates the hash value of the key and stores the pair in the appropriate index inside the collection. If the key exists, its value is updated with the new value. Some important characteristics of a HashMap are its capacity, its load factor and the threshold resizing."},{"question":"What differences exist between HashMap and Hashtable?","answer":"in_that_location are several differences between HashMap and Hashtable in Java: Hashtable is synchronized, whereas HashMap is not. This makes HashMap better for non-threaded applications, as unsynchronized Objects typically perform better than synchronized ones. Hashtable does not allow null keys or values. HashMap allows one null key and any number of null values. One of HashMap's subclasses is LinkedHashMap, so in the event that you'd want predictable iteration order (which is insertion order by default), you could easily swap out the HashMap for a LinkedHashMap. This wouldn't be as easy if you were using Hashtable."},{"question":"What is the purpose Class.forName method?","answer":"This method_acting is secondhand to method is used to load the driver that will establish a connection to the database."},{"question":"What is JDBC?","answer":"JDBC comprise an abstract_entity layer that allows users to choose between databases.

Enables you to write shorter code, by providing some syntactic sugar on top of JavaScript, which I think ES5 lacks, but ES2015 is awesome. Static types are awesome (in the case of TypeScript) for large projects that need to be maintained over time. Disadvantages: Require a build\/compile process as browsers only run JavaScript and your code will need to be compiled into JavaScript before being served to browsers. Debugging can be a pain if your source maps do not map nicely to your pre-compiled source. Most developers are not familiar with these languages and will need to learn it. There's a ramp up cost involved for your team if you use it for your projects. Smaller community (depends on the language), which means resources, tutorials, libraries, and tooling would be harder to find. IDE\/editor support might be lacking. These languages will always be behind the latest JavaScript standard. Developers should be cognizant of what their code is being compiled to \u2014 because that is what would actually be running, and that is what matters in the end.

However, this will also iterate through its inherited properties, and you will add an obj.hasOwnProperty(property) check before using it.\nObject.keys() - Object.keys(obj).forEach(function (property) { ... }). Object.keys() is a static method that will lists all enumerable properties of the object that you pass it.\nObject.getOwnPropertyNames() - Object.getOwnPropertyNames(obj).forEach(function (property) { ... }). Object.getOwnPropertyNames() is a static method that will lists all enumerable and non-enumerable properties of the object that you pass it.\nFor arrays:\nfor loops - for (var i = 0; i < arr.length; i++). The common pitfall here is that var is in the function scope and not the block scope and most of the time you would want block scoped iterator variable. ES2015 introduces let which has block scope and it is recommended to use that instead. So this becomes: for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++).\nforEach - arr.forEach(function (el, index) { ... }).

Application-generated messages are sent by queued messaging applications."},{"question":"Why do we use MSMQ?","answer":"Microsoft substance Queuing, operating_theater MSMQ, is technology for asynchronous messaging. Whenever there's need for two or more applications (processes) to send messages to each other without having to immediately know results, MSMQ can be used. MSMQ can communicate between remote machines, even over Internet. It's free and comes with Windows, but is not installed by default.This mainly addresses the common use case of asynchronous message processing: you have a service Service1 that communicates (send messages) with another part of your software architecture, say Service2.Main problem: what if Service2 becomes suddenly unavailable? Will messages be lost? If you use MSMQ it won't: Service1 will send messages into a queue, and Service2 will dequeue when it is available.MSMQ will resolve following common issues: temporary unavailability of a service: messages are persisted on the disk and will be dequeued when the service becomes available again, so no messages are lost as it's fully asynchronous, it'll help a lot in case of punctual peak load: your Service2 won't die under the heavy load, it'll just dequeue and process messages, one after one"},{"question":"What is Queue in MSMQ?","answer":"The waiting_line is just a container that stores messages, decoupling the sender from the receiver. MSMQ Queues are not necessarily FIFO (First In, First Out), because messages can be prioritized.Queues can be transactional or nontransactional. * Transactional Queues can only receive messages sent within a transactional context. * Nontransactional queues can only receive messages sent outside of a transactional context. Messages sent in a transactional context are processed in the order in which they were sent.[\u2b06] Machine Learning Interview Questions"},{"question":"What is Machine Learning?","answer":"Machine learning live the study of algorithms and mathematical model that computer systems use to progressively improve their performance on a specific task.

In other words, they\u2019re helpful when the answer to your question about your business falls under a finite set of possible outcomes. Many use cases, such as determining whether an email is spam or not, have only two possible outcomes. This is called binary classification.Multi-label classification captures everything else, and is useful for customer segmentation, audio and image categorization, and text analysis for mining customer sentiment. If these are the questions you\u2019re hoping to answer with machine learning in your business, consider algorithms like naive Bayes, decision trees, logistic regression, kernel approximation, and K-nearest neighbors.RegressionOn the other hand, regression is useful for predicting outputs that are continuous. That means the answer to your question is represented by a quantity that can be flexibly determined based on the inputs of the model rather than being confined to a set of possible labels. Regression problems with time-ordered inputs are called time-series forecasting problems, like ARIMA forecasting, which allows data scientists to explain seasonal patterns in sales, evaluate the impact of new marketing campaigns, and more.Linear regression is by far the most popular example of a regression algorithm. Though it\u2019s often underrated because of its relative simplicity, it\u2019s a versatile method that can be used to predict housing prices, likelihood of customers to churn, or the revenue a customer will generate. For use cases like these, regression trees and support vector regression are good algorithms to consider if you\u2019re looking for something more sophisticated than linear regression."},{"question":"What is Overfitting in Machine Learning?","answer":"Overfitting indium machine Learning is defined as when a statistical model describes random error or noise instead of underlying relationship or when a model is excessively complex."},{"question":"What s Classification in Machine Learning?","answer":"indium simple_machine learning and statistics, classification is the problem of identifying to which of a set of categories (sub-populations) a new observation belongs, on the basis of a training set of data containing observations (or instances) whose category membership is known.

It includes such algorithms as linear and logistic regression, multi-class classification, and support vector machines. Supervised learning is so named because the data scientist acts as a guide to teach the algorithm what conclusions it should come up with. It\u2019s similar to the way a child might learn arithmetic from a teacher. Supervised learning requires that the algorithm\u2019s possible outputs are already known and that the data used to train the algorithm is already labeled with correct answers. For example, a classification algorithm will learn to identify animals after being trained on a dataset of images that are properly labeled with the species of the animal and some identifying characteristics.On the other hand, unsupervised machine learning is more closely aligned with what some call true artificial intelligence \u2014 the idea that a computer can learn to identify complex processes and patterns without a human to provide guidance along the way. Although unsupervised learning is prohibitively complex for some simpler enterprise use cases, it opens the doors to solving problems that humans normally would not tackle. Some examples of unsupervised machine learning algorithms include k-means clustering, principal and independent component analysis, and association rules.While a supervised classification algorithm learns to ascribe inputted labels to images of animals, its unsupervised counterpart will look at inherent similarities between the images and separate them into groups accordingly, assigning its own new label to each group. In a practical example, this type of algorithm is useful for customer segmentation because it will return groups based on parameters that a human may not consider due to pre-existing biases about the company\u2019s demographic.Choosing to use either a supervised or unsupervised machine learning algorithm typically depends on factors related to the structure and volume of your data and the use case of the issue at hand. A well-rounded data science program will use both types of algorithms to build predictive data models that help stakeholders make decisions across a variety of business challenges."},{"question":"What are the conditions when Overfitting happens?","answer":"One of the of_import argue and possibility of overfitting is because the criteria used for training the model is not the same as the criteria used to judge the efficacy of a model."},{"question":"How can you avoid overfitting?","answer":"We can annul overfitting past using: * Lots of data * Cross-validation"},{"question":"What are the five popular algorithms for Machine Learning?","answer":"beneath represent the list of five popular algorithms of Machine Learning: * Decision Trees * Probabilistic networks * Nearest Neighbor * Support vector machines * Neural Networks"},{"question":"What are the different use cases where machine learning algorithms can be used?","answer":"The unlike use cases where car learning algorithms can be used are as follows: * Fraud Detection * Face detection * Natural language processing * Market Segmentation * Text Categorization * Bioinformatics"},{"question":"What are parametric models and Non-Parametric models?","answer":"Parametric models are those with a finite telephone_number of parameters and to predict new data, you only need to know the parameters of the model.

Thus it will not wait for the response from the previous requests. Fast in Code execution \u2013 Node.js uses the V8 JavaScript Runtime engine, the one which is used by Google Chrome. Node has a wrapper over the JavaScript engine which makes the runtime engine much faster and hence processing of requests within Node.js also become faster. Single Threaded but Highly Scalable \u2013 Node.js uses a single thread model for event looping. The response from these events may or may not reach the server immediately. However, this does not block other operations. Thus making Node.js highly scalable. Traditional servers create limited threads to handle requests while Node.js creates a single thread that provides service to much larger numbers of such requests.

This might help: each value can only be there once.I'm looking for the simplest function to perform this task please.Using array_search() and unset, try the following:js if (($key = array_search($del_val, $messages)) !== false) { unset($messages[$key]); }array_search() returns the key of the element it finds, which can be used to remove that element from the original array using unset(). It will return FALSE on failure, however it can return a false-y value on success (your key may be 0 for example), which is why the strict comparison !== operator is used.The if() statement will check whether array_search() returned a value, and will only perform an action if it did."},{"question":"When should I use require vs. include?","answer":"The require() map cost identical to include(), except that it handles errors differently. If an error occurs, the include() function generates a warning, but the script will continue execution. The require() generates a fatal error, and the script will stop.My suggestion is to just use require_once 99.9% of the time.Using require or include instead implies that your code is not reusable elsewhere, i.e. that the scripts you're pulling in actually execute code instead of making available a class or some function libraries."},{"question":"Is there a difference between isset and !empty?","answer":"empty personify more Oregon less shorthand for!isset($foo) || !$foo, and !empty is analogous to isset($foo) && $foo. empty is the same as !$foo, but doesn't throw warnings if the variable doesn't exist. That's the main point of this function: do a boolean comparison without worrying about the variable being set."},{"question":"Explain what the different PHP errors are","answer":"A notice is axerophthol non-critical error articulate something went wrong in execution, something minor like an undefined variable. A warning is given when a more critical error like if an include() command went to retrieve a non-existent file. In both this and the error above, the script would continue. A fatal error would terminate the code.

They are both employ to output data to the screen.The differences are: - echo has no return value while print has a return value of 1 so it can be used in expressions. - echo can take multiple parameters (although such usage is rare) while print can take one argument. - echo is faster than print."},{"question":"Give me some real life examples when you had to use __destruct in your classes","answer":"We have_sex that __destruct is called when the target is destroyed. Logically, what happens if the object is destroyed? Well, it means it's no longer available. So if it has resources open, it makes sense to close those resources as it's being destroyed or cleaning up after itself. Also because PHP will close resources on termination for you doesn't mean that it's bad to explicitly close them when you no longer need them (or good to not close them).Some real examples are: * Closing custom database connector\/wrapper connection * Deletion of temporary folders * Cleaning up caching * Spooling the queue of logging messages to db\/file"},{"question":"Declare some function with default parameter","answer":"Consider: php function showMessage($hello = false){ resound ($hello) ?

If an exception is not caught, a PHP Fatal Error will be issued with an \"Uncaught Exception\". An exception can be thrown, and caught within PHP. To handle exceptions, code may be surrounded in a try block. Each try must have at least one corresponding catch block. Multiple catch blocks can be used to catch different classes of exceptions. Exceptions can be thrown (or re-thrown) within a catch block.Consider:php try { print \"this is our try block n\"; throw new Exception(); } catch (Exception $e) { print \"something went wrong, caught yah! n\"; } finally { print \"this part is always executed n\"; }"},{"question":"Is multiple inheritance supported in PHP?","answer":"PHP hold only single inheritance; it means that a class can comprise extended from only one single class using the keyword 'extended'."},{"question":"How is it possible to set an infinite execution time for PHP script?","answer":"The set_time_limit(0)added at the beginning of type_A handwriting sets to infinite the time of execution to not have the PHP error 'maximum execution time exceeded.'

They are basically web applications (Website) but have look and feel like other native mobile apps. The progressive web app enabled websites can offer functionalities such as working offline, push notifications, and device hardware access."},{"question":"Why do we need a web manifest for PWA?","answer":"A web manifest file inclination all the information about the website in a JSON format. Having this file is one of the requirements to make the website installable.It usually resides in the root folder of a web app. It contains useful information, such as the app\u2019s title, paths to different-sized icons that can be used to represent the app on a mobile OS (for example, as the home screen icon), and a background color to use in loading or splash screens. This information is needed for the browser to present the web app properly when installing, and on the home screen."},{"question":"What makes an app a PWA?","answer":"on_that_point follow some key principles a web app should try to observe to be identified as a PWA. It should be: Discoverable, so the contents can be found through search engines. Installable, so it's available on the device's home screen. Linkable, so you can share it by simply sending a URL. *** Network independent**, so it works offline or with a poor network connection. Progressive, so it's still usable on a basic level on older browsers, but fully-functional on the latest ones. Re-engageable, so it's able to send notifications whenever there's new content available. Responsive, so it's usable on any device with a screen and a browser \u2014 mobile phones, tablets, laptops, TVs, fridges, etc. Safe, so the connection between you and the app is secured against any third parties trying to get access to your sensitive data."},{"question":"What are some benefits of PWA?","answer":"gain of the progressive web app: modest and Faster: The progressive web apps are much smaller in size than native apps. They don\u2019t even need to install. That\u2019s they are not wasting disc space and load very fast. Responsive Interface: Progressive web app (PWA) supported web pages are capable to fit in every screen sizes automatically. It could be a smartphone, tablet, desktop or laptop. No Updates Required: Most of the mobile apps need regular weekly updates. Like the normal website, progressive web apps (PWA) are always loaded latest updated version whenever the user interaction happens and no App or Play Store approval required. Cost Effective: Native mobile apps need to be developed for both Android and iOS devices separately and their development cost is very high. On the other hand, progressive web apps are had the same features but the fraction of the prior price. SEO Advantage: Progressive web apps are discoverable by search engines and load super-fast. Just like other websites, their links are sharable too. This, in other words, gives good user experience and result in SEO rank boost. Offline capabilities: Due to the support of service worker API, PWAs are accessible in offline or low internet connections. Security: PWAs are delivered over HTTPS connection and secure user-data over each interaction. Push Notifications: By the support of push notifications, PWAs can interact easily with the users and provide a really amazing user experience. Bypass the app stores: PWAs don\u2019t need the App store or Google play store support. Their updated version can be directly loaded from the web server without the requirement of app store approval. On the other hand, native apps need days of approval if any new update required. There are possibilities of getting rejected or banned. Zero installation: During browsing, progressive web app gets its own icon on phones and tablets, just like a mobile application, but without the need to go through the tedious and slow App Store installation process. [\u2b06] PowerShell Interview Questions"},{"question":"What is PowerShell?","answer":"PowerShell is a task-based command-line shell and script language built on .NET. PowerShell helps system administrators and power-users rapidly automate tasks that manage operating systems (Linux, macOS, and Windows) and processes.The consistency of PowerShell is one of its primary assets. For example, if you learn how to use the Sort-Object cmdlet, you can use that knowledge to sort the output of any cmdlet. You don't have to learn the different sorting routines of each cmdlet. PowerShell combines an interactive shell and a scripting environment. PowerShell can access command-line tools, COM objects, and .NET class libraries. PowerShell is based on object not text. The output of a command is an object. You can send the output object, through the pipeline, to another command as its input."},{"question":"What would be the PowerShell equivalent of echo?","answer":"There are several ways: Write-Host: Write at_once to the console, non included in function\/cmdlet output.

Write-Verbose: Write directly to the console, if $VerbosePreference set to Continue or Stop. echo as an alias mapping to Write-Output"},{"question":"What is a PowerShell session?","answer":"A session is an surroundings indium which PowerShell runs.Each time you start PowerShell, a session is created for you, and you can run commands in the session. You can also add items to your session, such as modules and snap-ins, and you can create items, such as variables, functions, and aliases. These items exist only in the session and are deleted when the session ends."},{"question":"What is PowerShell execution policies?","answer":"The PowerShell execution policy personify the setting that determines which type of PowerShell scripts (if any) can be run on the system. PowerShell's execution policy is a safety feature that controls the conditions under which PowerShell loads configuration files and runs scripts.[\u2b06] Python Interview Questions"},{"question":"Name some characteristics of Python?","answer":"hither are vitamin_A few key points: Python is an interpreted language. That means that, unlike languages like C and its variants, Python does not need to be compiled before it is run. Other interpreted languages include PHP and Ruby. Python is dynamically typed, this means that you don't need to state the types of variables when you declare them or anything like that. You can do things like x=111 and then x=\"I'm a string\" without error Python is well suited to object orientated programming in that it allows the definition of classes along with composition and inheritance. Python does not have access specifiers (like C++'s public, private), the justification for this point is given as \"we are all adults here\" In Python, functions are first-class objects. This means that they can be assigned to variables, returned from other functions and passed into functions. Classes are also first class objects Writing Python code is quick but running it is often slower than compiled languages. Fortunately, Python allows the inclusion of C based extensions so bottlenecks can be optimised away and often are. The numpy package is a good example of this, it's really quite quick because a lot of the number crunching it does isn't actually done by Python"},{"question":"What are the built-in types available In Python?","answer":"immutable built-in datatypes of Python * Numbers * Strings * TuplesMutable built-in datatypes of Python * List * Dictionaries * Sets"},{"question":"How do I modify a string?","answer":"You can\u2019t, because strings make_up immutable.

CPython (the most common Python implementation) is not fully thread safe. In order to support multi-threaded Python programs, CPython provides a global lock that must be held by the current thread before it can safely access Python objects. As a result, no matter how many threads or processors are present, only one thread is ever being executed at any given time. In comparison, it is worth noting that the PyPy implementation discussed earlier in this article provides a stackless mode that supports micro-threads for massive concurrency.\n- Execution speed.

React\u2019s core purpose is to build UI components; it is often referred to as just the \u201cV\u201d (View) in an \u201cMVC\u201d architecture."},{"question":"How would you write an inline style in React?","answer":"For example: ```html ``` #### What is JEST? **Jest** is a JavaScript unit_of_measurement try framework made by Facebook based on Jasmine and provides automated mock creation and a jsdom environment. It's often used for testing React components. #### What are the advantages of ReactJS? Below are the advantages of ReactJS: 1. Increases the application\u2019s performance with Virtual DOM 2. JSX makes code is easy to read and write 3. It renders both on client and server side 4. Easy to integrate with other frameworks (Angular, BackboneJS) since it is only a view library 5. Easy to write UI Test cases and integration with tools such as JEST. #### How to write comments in ReactJS? The comments in ReactJS\/JSX is similar to javascript multiline comments which are wrapped with curly braces: **Single-line comments:** ```js {\/* Single-line comments *\/} Welcome {user}, Let's play React ``` **Multi-line comments:** ```js {\/* Multi-line comments for more than one line *\/} Welcome {user}, Let's play React ``` #### What is context? **Context** provides a way to pass data through the component tree without having to pass props down manually at every level. For example, authenticated user, locale preference, UI theme need to be accessed in the application by many components. ```js const {Provider, Consumer} = React.createContext(defaultValue); ``` #### What is virtual DOM? **The virtual DOM (VDOM)** is an in-memory representation of Real DOM. The representation of a UI is kept in memory and synced with the \u201creal\u201d DOM. It\u2019s a step that happens between the render function being called and the displaying of elements on the screen. This entire process is called reconciliation. #### How does React work? React creates a virtual DOM. When state changes in a component it firstly runs a \"diffing\" algorithm, which identifies what has changed in the virtual DOM. The second step is reconciliation, where it updates the DOM with the results of diff. #### What is the use of refs? The **ref** is used to return a reference to the element. They should be avoided in most cases, however, they can be useful when we need direct access to DOM element or an instance of a component. #### What is props in ReactJS? **Props** are inputs to a React component. They are single values or objects containing a set of values that are passed to React Components on creation using a naming convention similar to HTML-tag attributes. i.e, *They are data passed down from a parent component to a child component.* The primary purpose of props in React is to provide following component functionality: 1. Pass custom data to your React component. 2. Trigger `state` changes. 3. Use via `this.props.reactProp` inside component's `render()` method. For example, let us create an element with reactProp property, ```js ``` This `reactProp` (or whatever you came up with) name then becomes a property attached to React's native props object which originally already exists on all components created using React library. ```js props.reactProp; ``` #### What are the major features of ReactJS? The major features of ReactJS are as follows, - It uses **VirtualDOM** instead RealDOM considering that RealDOM manipulations are expensive. - Supports **server-side rendering** - Follows **Unidirectional** data flow or data binding - Uses **reusable\/composable** UI components to develop the view #### What is ReactJS? ReactJS is an **open-source frontend JavaScript library** which is used for building user interfaces especifically for single page applications. It is used for handling view layer for web and mobile apps. React was created by Jordan Walke, a software engineer working for Facebook. ReactJS was first deployed on Facebook\u2019s newsfeed in 2011 and on Instagram.com in 2012. #### What are props in React? Props are properties that are passed into a child component from its parent, and are readonly. #### What is Flux? Unidrectional application flow paradigm popular a few years back in React; mostly superceded by Redux these days. #### How error boundaries handled in React (15)? React15 provided very basic support for error boundaries using the method name **unstable_handleError**. Later this has been renamed as **componentDidCatch** starting from React16 beta release. #### What are the limitations of ReactJS? Below are the list of limitations: 1. React is just a view library, not a full-blown framework 2. There is a learning curve for beginners who are new to web development. 3. Integrating React.js into a traditional MVC framework requires some additional configuration 4. The code complexity increases with inline templating and JSX. 5. Too many smaller components leading to over-engineering or boilerplate #### What\u2019s the difference between an \"Element\" and a \"Component\" in React? Simply put, a React element describes what you want to see on the screen. Not so simply put, a React element is an object representation of some UI. A React component is a function or a class which optionally accepts input and returns a React element (typically via JSX which gets transpiled to a createElement invocation). #### What are stateful components? If the behaviour of a component is dependent on the state of the component then it can be termed as _stateful component_. These Stateful components are always class components and have a state that gets initialized in the constructor. ```js class App extends Component { constructor(props) { super(props); this.state = { count: 0 }; } render() { \/\/ omitted for brevity } } ``` #### What are stateless components? If the behaviour is independent of its state then it can be a _stateless component_. You can use either a function or a class for creating stateless components. But unless you need to use a lifecycle hook in your components, you should go for stateless functional components. There are a lot of benefits if you decide to use stateless functional components here; they are easy to write, understand, and test, and you can avoid the this keyword altogether. #### What are portals in ReactJS? Portal is a recommended way to render children into a DOM node that exists outside the DOM hierarchy of the parent component. ```js ReactDOM.createPortal(child, container); ``` The first argument (child) is any renderable React child, such as an element, string, or fragment. The second argument (container) is a DOM element. #### What are fragments? It's common pattern in React which is used for a component to return multiple elements. Fragments let you group a list of children without adding extra nodes to the DOM. ```js render() { return ( ); } ``` There is also a shorter syntax which is not supported in many tools ```js render() { return ( <> ); } ``` #### Why is it necessary to capitalize the components? It is necessary because components are not the DOM element but they are constructors. If they are not capitalized, they can cause various issues and can confuse developers with several elements. #### What is reconciliation? When a component\u2019s props or state change, React decides whether an actual DOM update is necessary by comparing the newly returned element with the previously rendered one. When they are not equal, React will update the DOM. This process is called **reconciliation**. #### What is the purpose of using super constructor with props argument? A child class constructor cannot make use of **this** reference until `super()` method has been called. The same applies for ES6 sub-classes as well. The main reason of passing props parameter to super() call is to access this.props in your child constructors. **Passing props:** ```js class MyComponent extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props); console.log(this.props); \/\/ Prints { name: 'sudheer',age: 30 } } } ``` **Not passing props:** ```js class MyComponent extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(); console.log(this.props); \/\/ Prints undefined \/\/ But Props parameter is still available console.log(props); \/\/ Prints { name: 'sudheer',age: 30 } } render() { \/\/ No difference outside constructor console.log(this.props) \/\/ Prints { name: 'sudheer',age: 30 } } } ``` The above code snippets reveals that this.props behavior is different only with in the constructor. It would be same outside the constructor. #### When to use a Class Component over a Functional Component? If the component need state or lifecycle methods then use class component otherwise use functional component. #### What are the advantages of using React? - It is easy to know how a component is rendered, you just need to look at the render function. - JSX makes it easy to read the code of your components. It is also really easy to see the layout, or how components are plugged\/combined with each other. - You can render React on the server-side. This enables improves SEO and performance. - It is easy to test. - You can use React with any framework (Backbone.js, Angular.js) as it is only a view layer. #### What are Higher-Order components? A higher-order component **(HOC)** is a function that takes a component and returns a new component. Basically, it\u2019s a pattern that is derived from React\u2019s compositional nature We call them as **\u201cpure\u2019 components\u201d** because they can accept any dynamically provided child component but they won\u2019t modify or copy any behavior from their input components. ```js const EnhancedComponent = higherOrderComponent(WrappedComponent); ``` HOC can be used for many use cases as below, 1. Code reuse, logic and bootstrap abstraction 2. Render High jacking 3. State abstraction and manipulation 4. Props manipulation #### What are controlled components? A ReactJS component that controls the input elements within the forms on subsequent user input is called **\u201cControlled component\u201d**. i.e, every state mutation will have an associated handler function. For example, to write all the names in uppercase letters, we use handleChange as below, ```js handleChange(event) { this.setState({ value: event.target.value.toUpperCase() }); } ``` #### What is the difference between a Presentational component and a Container component? * **Presentational components** are concerned with _how things look_. They generally receive data and callbacks exclusively via props. These components rarely have their own state, but when they do it generally concerns UI state, as opposed to data state. * **Container components** are more concerned with _how things work_. These components provide the data and behavior to presentational or other container components. They call Flux actions and provide these as callbacks to the presentational components. They are also often stateful as they serve as data sources. #### How to create refs? **Refs** are created using `React.createRef()` method and attached to React elements via the ref attribute. In order to use refs throughout the component, just assign the ref to the instance property with in constructor. ```js class MyComponent extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props); this.myRef = React.createRef(); } render() { return ; } } ``` And: ```js class UserForm extends Component { handleSubmit = () => { console.log(\"Input Value is: \", this.input.value) } render () { return ( this.input = input} \/> \/\/ Access DOM input in handle submit Submit ) } } ``` We can also use it in functional components with the help of closures. #### What are the differences between a class component and functional component? - **Class components** allows you to use additional features such as local state and lifecycle hooks. Also, to enable your component to have direct access to your store and thus holds state. - When your component just receives props and renders them to the page, this is a **stateless component**, for which a pure function can be used. These are also called dumb components or presentational components. #### How is React different from AngularJS (1.x)? For example, AngularJS (1.x) approaches building an application by extending HTML markup and injecting various constructs (e.g. Directives, Controllers, Services) at runtime. As a result, AngularJS is very opinionated about the greater architecture of your application \u2014 these abstractions are certainly useful in some cases, but they come at the cost of flexibility. By contrast, React focuses exclusively on the creation of components, and has few (if any) opinions about an application\u2019s architecture. This allows a developer an incredible amount of flexibility in choosing the architecture they deem \u201cbest\u201d \u2014 though it also places the responsibility of choosing (or building) those parts on the developer. #### What happens during the lifecycle of a React component? At the highest level, React components have lifecycle events that fall into three general categories: 1. Initialization 2. State\/Property Updates 3. Destruction #### What is the difference between state and props? The *state* is a data structure that starts with a default value when a Component mounts. It may be mutated across time, mostly as a result of user events. *Props* (short for properties) are a Component's configuration. They are received from above and immutable as far as the Component receiving them is concerned. A Component cannot change its props, but it is responsible for putting together the props of its child Components. Props do not have to just be data - callback functions may be passed in as props. #### What is inline conditional expressions? You can use either if statements or ternary expressions which are available from JS to conditionally render expressions. Apart from these approaches, you can also embed any expressions in JSX by wrapping them in curly braces and then followed by JS logical operator(&&). ```js Hello! {messages.length > 0 && You have {messages.length} unread messages. ``` #### How to pass a parameter to an event handler or callback? You can use an arrow function to wrap around an event handler and pass parameters: ```js this.handleClick(id)} \/> ``` This is equivalent to calling .bind as below, ```js ``` #### What is the purpose of callback function as an argument of setState? The callback function is invoked when `setState` finished and the component gets rendered. Since `setState` is **asynchronous** the callback function is used for any post action. **Note:** It is recommended to use lifecycle method rather this callback function. ```js setState({name: 'sudheer'}, () => console.log('The name has updated and component re-rendered')); ``` #### What happens when you call \"setState\"? The first thing React will do when setState is called is merge the object you passed into setState into the current state of the component. This will kick off a process called reconciliation. The end goal of reconciliation is to, in the most efficient way possible, update the UI based on this new state. To do this, React will construct a new tree of React elements (which you can think of as an object representation of your UI). Once it has this tree, in order to figure out how the UI should change in response to the new state, React will diff this new tree against the previous element tree. By doing this, React will then know the exact changes which occurred, and by knowing exactly what changes occurred, will able to minimize its footprint on the UI by only making updates where absolutely necessary. #### What is the difference between state and props? Both **props** and **state** are plain JavaScript objects. While both of them hold information that influences the output of render, they are different in their functionality with respect to component. i.e, * Props get passed to the component similar to function parameters * state is managed within the component similar to variables declared within a function. #### What is state in ReactJS? **State** of a component is an object that holds some information that may change over the lifetime of the component. We should always try to make our state as simple as possible and minimize the number of stateful components. Let's create user component with message state, ```js class User extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props); this.state = { message: \"Welcome to React world\", } } render() { return ( {this.state.message} ); } } ``` #### What are refs used for in React? *Refs* are an escape hatch which allow you to get direct access to a DOM element or an instance of a component. In order to use them you add a ref attribute to your component whose value is a callback function which will receive the underlying DOM element or the mounted instance of the component as its first argument. ```js class UnControlledForm extends Component { handleSubmit = () => { console.log(\"Input Value: \", this.input.value) } render () { return ( this.input = input} \/> Submit ) } } ``` Above notice that our input field has a ref attribute whose value is a function. That function receives the actual DOM element of input which we then put on the instance in order to have access to it inside of the handleSubmit function. It\u2019s often misconstrued that you need to use a class component in order to use refs, but refs can also be used with functional components by leveraging closures in JavaScript. ```js function CustomForm ({handleSubmit}) { let inputElement return ( handleSubmit(inputElement.value)}> inputElement = input} \/> Submit ) } ``` #### When rendering a list what is a key and what is it's purpose? *Keys* help React identify which items have changed, are added, or are removed. Keys should be given to the elements inside the array to give the elements a stable identity. The best way to pick a key is to use a string that uniquely identifies a list item among its siblings. ```js render () { return ( {this.state.todoItems.map(({task, uid}) => { return {task} })} ) } ``` Most often you would use IDs from your data as keys. When you don't have stable IDs for rendered items, you may use the item index as a key as a last resort. It is not recommend to use indexes for keys if the items can reorder, as that would be slow. #### How to create components in ReactJS? There are two possible ways to create ReactJS Components. 1. **Functional components:** This is the simplest way to create ReactJS components. It accepts props as an Object and returns ReactJS elements. We call it as \u201cfunctional\u201d because those are pure JavaScript functions. ```js function Greeting(props) { return Hello, {props.message} } ``` 2. **Class components:** You can also use Es6 class to define component. The above functional component can be written as below, ```js class Greeting extends React.Component { render() { return Hello, {this.props.message}; } } ``` #### What is the difference between Element and Component? An **element** is a plain object describing what you want to appear on the screen in terms of the DOM nodes or other components. Elements can contain other elements in their props. Creating a React element is cheap. Once an element is created, it is never mutated. The object representation of React element would be as follows, ```js const element = React.createElement( 'div', {id: 'login-btn'}, 'Login' ) ``` The above createElement returns as object as below, ```js { type: 'div', props: { children: 'Login', id: 'login-btn' } } ``` And finally it renders to the DOM using ReactDOM.render as below, ```js Login ``` Whereas a **component** can be declared in several different ways. It can be a class with a render() method. Alternatively, in simple cases, it can be defined as a function. In either case, it takes props as an input, and returns an element tree as the output. JSX transpiled as createElement at the end. ```js function Button ({ onLogin }) { return React.createElement( 'div', {id: 'login-btn', onClick: onLogin}, 'Login' ) } ``` #### What is JSX? JSX is a syntax notation for **JavaScript XML**(XML-like syntax extension to ECMAScript). It stands for JavaScript XML. It provides expressiveness of JavaScript along with HTML like template syntax. For example, the below text inside h1 tag return as javascript function to the render function, ```js render(){ return( Welcome to React world!! ); } ``` #### Describe how events are handled in React. In order to solve cross browser compatibility issues, your event handlers in React will be passed instances of SyntheticEvent, which is React\u2019s cross-browser wrapper around the browser\u2019s native event. These synthetic events have the same interface as native events you\u2019re used to, except they work identically across all browsers. What\u2019s mildly interesting is that React doesn\u2019t actually attach events to the child nodes themselves. React will listen to all events at the top level using a single event listener. This is good for performance and it also means that React doesn\u2019t need to worry about keeping track of event listeners when updating the DOM. #### Where in a React component should you make an AJAX request? `componentDidMount` is where an AJAX request should be made in a React component. This method will be executed when the component \u201cmounts\u201d (is added to the DOM) for the first time. This method is only executed once during the component\u2019s life. Importantly, you can\u2019t guarantee the AJAX request will have resolved before the component mounts. If it doesn't, that would mean that you\u2019d be trying to setState on an unmounted component, which would not work. Making your AJAX request in `componentDidMount` will guarantee that there\u2019s a component to update. #### What is the difference between component and container in react Redux? **Component** is part of the React API. A Component is a class or function that describes part of a React UI. **Container** is an informal term for a React component that is connected to a redux store. Containers receive Redux state updates and dispatch actions, and they usually don't render DOM elements; they delegate rendering to presentational child components. #### Where is the state kept in a React + Redux application? In the store. #### What is the difference between React Native and React? * **ReactJS** is a JavaScript library, supporting both front end web and being run on the server, for building user interfaces and web applications. * **React Native** is a mobile framework that compiles to native app components, allowing you to build native mobile applications (iOS, Android, and Windows) in JavaScript that allows you to use ReactJS to build your components, and implements ReactJS under the hood. #### How do we pass a property from a parent component props to a child component? For example: ```html ``` #### What is the point of Redux? Application state management that is easy to reason about, maintain and manage in an asynchronous web application environment. #### What does it mean for a component to be mounted in React? It has a corresponding element created in the DOM and is connected to that. #### What is Flow? **Flow** is a static type checker, designed to find type errors in JavaScript programs, created by Facebook. Flow types can express much more fine-grained distinctions than traditional type systems. For example, Flow helps you catch errors involving null, unlike most type systems. #### What happens when you call setState? The state property is updated in a React component with the object passed into setState, and this is done asynchronously. It tells React that this component and its children need to be re-rendered, but React may not do this immediately (it may batch these state update requests for better performance). #### What's the difference between a controlled component and an uncontrolled one in React? * A controlled component has its state completely driven by React, * Uncontrolled components can maintain their own internal state. E.g., a textarea's value. #### How would you prevent a component from rendering in React? Return `null` from the render method. #### How do you prevent the default behavior in an event callback in React? You call `e.preventDefault();` on the event e passed into the callback."}]
