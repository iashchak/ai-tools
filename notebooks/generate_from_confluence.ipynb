    "# Fine-tuning a model based on raw documents from Confluence\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook contains code for fine-tuning a model based on raw documents from Confluence.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "The process will contain several parts:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Data downloading\n",
    "We downloaded several examples from public available apache foundation Confluence to make a raw dataset. This step done outside of this notebook. You can read more about Confluence export here: [https://confluence.atlassian.com/doc/export-content-to-word-pdf-html-and-xml-139475.html](https://confluence.atlassian.com/doc/export-content-to-word-pdf-html-and-xml-139475.html)\n",
    "- Data extraction\n",
    "For data extraction from dumps we will use Apache Tika running on a separate docker container.\n",
    "Apache Tika - is a toolkit for detecting and extracting metadata and structured text content from various documents using existing parser libraries. You can read more about it here: [https://tika.apache.org/](https://tika.apache.org/)\n",
    "- Data processing\n",
    "We will use the dataset library to process the data. It is a library for loading and processing datasets in a few lines of code. You can read more about it here: [https://huggingface.co/docs/datasets/](https://huggingface.co/docs/datasets/)\n",
    "Also we have to extract instruction and data from the raw data.\n",
    "- Data augmentation\n",
    "Augmentation of dataset is a process of creating new data from existing data. In this case we use the model for paraphrasing to create new questions and answers.\n",
    "- Model fine-tuning\n",
    "Using modern techniques as PEFT, DeepSpeed, LoRA and Accelerate we will fine-tune the model on the dataset. You can read more about it here: [https://huggingface.co/transformers/training.html](https://huggingface.co/transformers/training.html) [https://huggingface.co/blog/peft](https://huggingface.co/blog/peft)\n"
