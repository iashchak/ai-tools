                    <p><em>This page is a work in progress. Comments and collaboration welcomed!</em></p><p>This is an informal program which aims to pair up newer developers (mentees) with mentors that can help them get more involved in Apache Hadoop development.</p><p><em>Note there is an existing program centered around Google Summer of Code (<a class="external-link" href="http://community.apache.org/guide-to-being-a-mentor.html" rel="nofollow">link</a></em><em>). We may still want to develop a less formal process as outlined here.</em></p><h2 id="HadoopMentorship-Expectations">Expectations</h2><p>Mentors should meet with their mentees once every week or two. We recommend a three month period of doing this. Being available via email is good, but meetings should be over phone or video conferencing if possible. (In person is even better, but often not possible.) We recommend taking shared notes to track progress and outstanding questions.</p><p>Mentees should come to the first meeting with some goals they have. Examples goals are: Submit code or documentation patches, do some code reviews, answer community questions, etc.. The mentor will try to help the mentee achieve these goals over the three month period by answering questions and providing reviews and constructive feedback.</p><p>We want to make it easy for more mentors to get involved. Keep in mind that mentors are typically very busy people. The idea is that just an hour or two a week is enough to help newer developers get involved, but can still fit into peoples' busy schedules. Mentees should try to be proactive and drive the process with the help of their mentors.</p><h2 id="HadoopMentorship-GettingStarted">Getting Started</h2><ul><li><p>If you want to participate, please fill out this <a class="external-link" href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScYsN5r2mNQlJmuKhq3S1u2ppAyVxsrsAeoQdoQKEzH4WAawg/viewform?usp=sf_link" rel="nofollow">survey</a></p></li></ul><p>Other Resources</p><ul style="list-style-type: square;"><li>The <a href="Hadoop-Contributor-Guide_89071892.html">Hadoop Contributor Guide</a> is a good place to start.</li><li>TODO Link to newbie JIRAs</li></ul><p><br/></p>
