It is a high volume list! For those who can't handle that kind of traffic, you can also get it in digest form.</p><p>If you post to tomcat-user, use good etiquette, ask good questions, and use Best Practices, and also please read the docs, faqs, readme, and search the archives before asking a question.</p><p>Here are some links about how to use mailing lists and standard etiquette in using mailing lists. These links are not Tomcat specific! Please do not contact the author of these documents with questions.</p><ul><li><a class="external-link" href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1855" rel="nofollow">Netiquette Guidelines (RFC 1855)</a></li><li><a class="external-link" href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html" rel="nofollow">How To Ask Questions The Smart Way</a></li></ul><h2 id="TomcatUsermailinglist-Questions">Questions</h2><ol><li><a href="#TomcatUsermailinglist-Q1">How do I subscribe?</a></li><li><a href="#TomcatUsermailinglist-Q2">Why won't people answer my question?</a></li><li><a href="#TomcatUsermailinglist-Q3">How do I unsubscribe?</a></li><li><a href="#TomcatUsermailinglist-Q4">Should I post to users or dev?</a></li></ol><h2 id="TomcatUsermailinglist-Answers">Answers</h2><h3 id="TomcatUsermailinglist-Q1HowdoIsubscribe?"><span class="confluence-anchor-link" id="TomcatUsermailinglist-Q1"></span>How do I subscribe?</h3><p>See the <a class="external-link" href="https://tomcat.apache.org/lists.html" rel="nofollow">mailing list page</a>. If you are unable to subscribe, it could be due to your e-mail system mangling your e-mail address.</p><p>If you send an e-mail to the list owner to subscribe you to the list, be prepared to wait until the owner has an opportunity to add you to the list.</p><h3 id="TomcatUsermailinglist-Q2Whywon&#39;tpeopleanswermyquestion?"><span class="confluence-anchor-link" id="TomcatUsermailinglist-Q2"></span>Why won't people answer my question?</h3><p>It could be one of any of the following answers:</p><ul><li>No one knows the answer.</li><li>Everyone is ignoring you.</li><li>The person who knows the answer hasn't gotten around to it yet.</li><li>The person who knows the answer hasn't gotten around to it yet. (So please don't post the same question multiple times)</li></ul><p>In other words - you get what you pay for. If you phrase you question intelligently and not make your question annoying, your quality of support will probably better than any commercial help support.</p><p>In particular, some readers on the tomcat-user list have been known to automatically ignore a message which meets any of the following criteria: (You have been warned)</p><ul><li>&quot;help&quot; in the subject line (we know you need help by writing in the first place)</li><li>plz or please in the subject line. We already know you need help.</li><li>ALL CAPS IN THE SUBJECT LINE. (Sorry for anyone emailing from a mainframe)</li><li>Do not place !! (more than 2!) in the subject line. The number of exclamation points has no relation to anyone's interest in answering the question. In fact - it has a higher chance at being ignored.</li><li>Your e-mail has a return receipt. You don't need to know I got the message.</li><li>Select posters who have consistently displayed no desire to research before posting a question.</li></ul><h3 id="TomcatUsermailinglist-Q3HowdoIunsubscribe?"><span class="confluence-anchor-link" id="TomcatUsermailinglist-Q3"></span>How do I unsubscribe?</h3><p>See the <a class="external-link" href="https://tomcat.apache.org/lists.html" rel="nofollow">mailing list page</a>.

That means anyone who is developing any type of software to be used with tomcat.</p><p>tomcat-dev is the forum to discuss changes to the Tomcat's source code. If your question is not related to changing the source code as maintained by the tomcat committers, then it does not belong here, it belongs on the users list.</p><p>If you wish to extend tomcat using your own Valve, Realm, or anything else ... those discussions belong in tomcat-user. You might be using Tomcat's internal API but unless your changes are going back into the official source tree, the question belongs on the user list.</p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p>
