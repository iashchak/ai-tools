# Contributing Guidelines

Thank you for considering contributing to our project! Here are some guidelines to help you get started.

## Project Overview

Our project aims to build a question answering model using the Transformers library from Hugging Face. We download and preprocess data from Wikipedia using natural language processing techniques and transformer-based models, fine-tune a pre-trained transformer model on the data, and generate answers to a set of predefined questions using the trained model.
